# Debugging CloudFront Distribution Issues

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced CloudFront Function Debugging**
   - Added debug headers to track URI transformations
   - Added logging to see the function code being deployed

2. **Improved Lambda@Edge Handler**
   - Enhanced debugging output to show full request details
   - Added error handling with detailed error information

3. **S3 Bucket Policy Improvements**
   - Added more permissive policy for debugging
   - Added explicit permissions for CloudFront service principal
   - Added ListBucket permission to help with directory browsing

4. **CloudFront Distribution Configuration**
   - Fixed function associations handling
   - Added more headers to forwarded values
   - Set cache TTL to 0 for dynamic content during debugging

5. **Added Type Definitions**
   - Created proper type definitions for routes and functions
   - Added utility functions for route management

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes and check CloudWatch logs for any errors
2. Test the CloudFront function by accessing various URLs
3. Check S3 bucket permissions and access logs
4. Verify Lambda@Edge execution and check its logs

## Common Issues to Look For

- CloudFront function syntax errors
- S3 bucket policy restrictions
- Lambda@Edge execution role permissions
- CloudFront distribution configuration issues
- Route handling and path pattern matching problems
