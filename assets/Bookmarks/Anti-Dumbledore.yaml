    I am bookmarking this under the "if you search for it more than twice" policy.  There is something quite appealing with the premise - quite a bit of good could have come if [Harry] had insisted on some quite reasonable explanations of a few things.  Particularly, if, as in this work, his questions had triggered the adults to even just barely notice how off some things are.  It could push this into being a [responsible adult]
    story except that its primary purpose is that [Dumbledore] is flawed.  The problem is that there is something deeply dissatisfying with the "lets rediscover that old magical families are in fact the answer to everything" idea.  It essentially means "pure blood fanatics are right, except that they are murderous bigots about it."
