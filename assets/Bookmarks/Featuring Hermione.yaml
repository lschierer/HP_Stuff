    This actually features [Neville], not [Hermione], but the story line is their relationship's development.  It is really well done, and the relationship between them feels incredibly *right* as it makes subtle changes to the story line.

    The idea of using magic to implement a body swap like the old _[Freaky Friday]_ movie is an interesting one.  We see instances of possession in the books, and polyjuice is sort of a one-way body switch, so it is not a *huge* leap from the magic we seen in the canonical sources. This one features [Hermione] and [Fred], which is a bit unusual and offers an interesting twist on the concept.

    [Harry] starts dating [Hermione] in the time-gap between Halloween and the first task of the TriWizard Tournament.  He discovers that [Dumbledore] could have declared the initial champion selection invalid, and that the Goblet of Fire is much more powerful than most people want to admit.

    I really think that [RobSt] bases his stories almost entirely off the movies and not the books.  That being said, I am including another of his stories because he has some good stuff in them despite his choice of pairing for [Harry].  In this case, what I really like is the way [McGonagall] is forced to face the consequences of her blind faith in [Dumbledore].  It is also nice to see a problematic [Molly] while [Ginny], though a minor character, remains firmly in [Harry]'s corner.

    This a well done take on the idea of sending memories back in time.  The author's choice on a [Harry]/[Hermione] pairing detracts from the story however.  This comes to a head in [Chapter 5] where [Hermione], the time traveller, is facing some of her memories.  I am unsure if the author simply felt forced to include these reactions to maintain harmony with the canonical timeline she left in the past, or if he was purposefully creating a juxtaposition between her supposed love for [Harry] and what we *actually* see in the books. If the latter, it was masterfully done, as that is *precisely* what comes across.
