    It is [Chapter 12. Ickle Ronnikins] that caused me to bookmark this one, though other chapters are worth mentioning.  This chapter is a truly dark look at certain canon events from [Ron]'s childhood culminating in an alternate ending.  Most of these stories are very dark.  Only about half have ideas worth reading.

    [Harry] gave the twins his TriWizard reward because he felt that the world would need more humor.  It tickles my fancy that they would take that seriously when [Ginny] needed it most.
