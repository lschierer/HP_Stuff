    This is primarily noteworthy for a couple reasons:
    * You rarely see [Professor Sprout] get called out for her behaviour in book four.
    * This is the second work I have seen with [Baron Samedi].  The idea of using evil against evil is middling interesting.
    * The idea that the tournament means that [Harry] is an adult is used as a plot device.

    This story leaves the question of [Horcruxes] in an ambiguous state. It is a surprisingly complete picture of [Harry] for such a short one-shot, but at the expense of any real epilogue to give a sense of closure.  There are a number of things I like in this that are mentioned but not fully explored. The author did write a sequel, but it is not nearly as interesting.
    * [Harry] realises that many of his problems are self caused in one sense,
      but the root cause is the effectively random oscillation between expecting
      him to handle things as an adult (which he isn't yet) and totally consign
      responsibilities over *to* the adults (despite the fact that he can see
      they are failing at handling things). I experienced this oscillation
      myself growing up, and it *does* make responding correctly very difficult.
      As a parent now, I also see the other side, how difficult it is to *not*
      do this to children.
    * [Harry] realises, looking back, that part of the separation from his
      friends was his own fault. We do not however, see more than hints of the
      *outcome* of this realisation.
    * This story lets [Harry] be an unusually strong wizard (most people
      cannot do nearly the wandless magic he can) without being overpowered
      (despite his prowess, without a wand he is still too weak to matter in a
      straight up magical fight). In other words, we can see him as the one
      marked by the "Dark Lord" as "his equal." I've argued that you cannot
      really do that even in the actual canonical books.

    I am using the date it was first published on [FanFiction.net] and the date it was completed on [Ao3].

    I hesitated on where best to file this story, either here, or in the [Harry]/[Ginny] category. I like several things about this story.
    * I like that [Harry]'s depression is treated as a disease that must be treated, and which compromises the legitimacy of his choices.
    * I like that the reaction to that depression is treated as morally ambiguous. Not because I think he would have been right to refuse
      treatment, but because I think it right to question the self-righteous attitudes that the culture has.
    * I like that [Dumbledore]'s treated as a grey figure trying to do good, and not always fully succeeding.
    * I like that the link between [Harry] and [Riddle] is presented as a disturbing thing that has consequences.

    There are also a few things I dislike.
    * I am not a huge fan of the reconciliation with [Draco], though I think it *much* better done than in the original canonical books.
    * I am not a huge fan of the way [Snape] is handled, though again, I think it done in a way far superior to the original canonical books.
    * Essentially I think any story (like this one) that shows one or both of these characters in their best light is in fact showing them at
      least somewhat *out* of character. I remain unconvinced that either character *has* a *truly* good "best light."
    * I tend to prefer happy endings, this one ends on an ambiguous note that truly fits the story well, but only sometimes fits my mood.

    The later you wait for [Harry] to "wake up" and realise that something is wrong at [Hogwarts] and with [Dumbledore], the less believable it is.  This story handles that aspect, the branch point, very well.  I believe the resulting take on [Harry]'s character is left somewhat inconsistent.  I think he does a pendulum swing from more intuitive than the books to more trusting than the books.  This shift happens a couple of times, and detracts from the story.

    In this story [Harry] stays in contact with [Sirius] after book 3.  On hearing something of his godson's adventures, [Sirius] is concerned, and so the two of them make plans to escape should something happen on year 4.  When [Harry]'s name emerges from the Goblet, they leave Britain. This could be a responsible adult story, but I think it fits here best.  There are several key things about this one.
    * It gets the relationship between [Harry] and [Hermione] spot on.
    * It also captures where [Ron] was quite well.  I think the author is right that without [Harry] physically present, [Ron] would never have moved on from that mental space.
    * It narrowly avoids [Ginny] bashing.  I am not fully pleased with the interpretation, but it is not implausible.
    * I am a bit sceptical about the author's interpretation of the magical economy.  We have so little information though that it is entirely possible.

    The media coverage can be overwhelming, too much to handle.  Fortunately those who love you will forgive you when you make a mistake.
