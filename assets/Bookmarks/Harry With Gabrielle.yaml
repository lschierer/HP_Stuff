    This story handles the age gap in two ways:
    * They do not get together until some time has passed,
    * The gap is a problem for [Harry], but magic is not always kind, nor always able to be undone.

    This handles the age gap because, through no fault of either party, [Harry] has been in magical stasis for sufficient time that there no longer *is* an age gap.
