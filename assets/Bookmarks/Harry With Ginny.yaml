    There are several inconsistencies that act as an irritant reading this one.  The author allows a few of his/her own language quirks to infect the dialog in several chapters.  I think it stands out becuase while a fairly harmless quirk, it is one I have not seen anywhere else, certainly not in the cannonical speach patterns, and secondly because it inconsistently infects the characters across the work.  Secondly, the author has some issues with spells: the vanishing charm and banishing charm are not at all the same thing for example.  This work takes as a point of departure the idea that [Ginny] might have had severe struggles with both PTSD, depression, and other control related issues steming from her first year and exacerbated by the events of the final battle.  It is not beyond belief, and the author handles the concept in a way that comes across to me as a lay person reasonably well. I also see in this a thread common to my analysis of [Ron], that he lacks any understanding of what makes [Harry] and [Ginny] tick, and thus their relationship. [Molly] is also believably handled, not precisely favorably, but not in any way bashing her.

    This is one of the few soul-bond stories that is finished.  It also is one of the rare ones that happens entirely after the war. Its an interesting take on the notion, and on the family's reaction.

    There are some minor alternate-universe elements to this one-shot that mar it slightly, but only slightly.  The key thing is that it aknowledges that [Harry] almost certainly has some emotional baggage, and that [Ginny] might well have to compensate for that in their relationship.

    In general the idea that [Ron] and [Hermione] are part of some plot to deceive and monitor [Harry] 24/7 is ludicrous.  Children simply are not capable of maintaining that level of deception.  This story however provides a reasonable explanation for the scenario.

    In this story, [Harry] does not trust [Dumbledore] after the revelations at the end of 5th year.  [Lupin] steps up to take an active role in [Harry]'s life, and [Ginny] doesn't date Dean.  One of the notable features of this story is that amulets are made to allow [Ginny] to siphon power from the other [Weasleys].

    This story features [Harry] and [Ginny], but is *really* about the failings of [Dumbledore] and [Lupin].  What would have happened if [Sirius] had not seen the newspaper from [Fudge], but rather died when [Riddle] raided Azkaban?

    This bond story is one of the longer ones.  I really like the way it does [Molly] and [Percy], and their opposition to [Harry] and
    [Ginny].  I dislike some of the other choices the author has made though.  There is a bit of torturing characters to provide angst, and the setup to cause the whole scenario is a bit chaotic.  The author attempted to fix this with a prequel that, I think, actually managed to confuse things more.

    This story ignores the concept of [Horcruxes], and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room in the
    Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like [Harry] as a phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What *really* like is the trunks.

    This story pre-dates [Ginny]'s confidence around [Harry] to
    his time in [Grimmauld Place] rather than the slower and mostly off
    "screen" build-up that we see in the canonical story line.  Here
    [Ginny] convinces and helps [Harry] to prepare for his trial rather
    than rely on [Dumbledore].  This turns out to be for the best, as
    [Lucius] is rather more openly active in this version.  It is
    unfortunate that the author did not develop this concept further.

    This could have gone in the [Time Travel] or [Harry Leaves] sections.  This is one of the stories where [Harry] sends his memories back in time.  Unlike most, this [Harry] decides that he is best off using his memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.

    Despite featuring [Harry] and [Ginny] together, I almost put this one in the [Featuring Hermione] category, as it leans towards [Hermione] as world saviour and [Harry] as *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would prefer a stronger [Ginny].

    Featuring a manipulative but not evil [Dumbledore], and a redeemable [Snape], this one is a super-powered [Harry] story with a bit of a twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

    I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that [Harry] and [Ginny] have met before, and so when [Harry] meets [Ron] on the train, [Ron] stalks off in a huff because he resents being viewed as [Ginny]'s brother (he wants to stand out remember).  This leaves [Harry] feeling very alone, so his wish at the Sorting is for a friend, and thus [Hufflepuff].... and it all flows from there.

    Despite its unfinished state, this is one of my favourite after the battle depictions.  One, I doubt [Mrs. Weasley] came face to face with that particular boggart made real without consequences.  Two, I do not think that [Mrs. Weasley] is ready for [Ginny] to be in a relationship. Yes, in book three they talk about love potions,[^220711-1] but given her over-protective and overbearing nature, I do not think she will be ready for [Ginny] to be in a *serious* romantic relationship until *she* sets said relationship up.  I suspect this remains true even if she would have otherwise approved of said relationship.  I also think that while [Ron] shows a fair amount of character growth across the latter chapters of book seven, he and [Hermione] have a lot further to go than [Harry]. This story gets all these things right.

    In many ways this is a shorter version of _[Realizations]_.
    The [Weasleys] think of [Ginny] as a little girl, therefore she cannot be
    in a serious relationship, therefore she isn't in one. [Harry] broke up
    with her, therefore he isn't interested in her, so why would they be
    together?  These two statements sum up all the energy that is left when
    you are lost in grief.  The downside to this shorter version is that [Ginny] does a ton of lying and then blames her family for norealizing she is lying.

    This story is another great example of [Harry] and [Ginny]'s mutually supporting relationship. This one is AU in that they get together sooner, and [Umbridge] is able to expel them.  This also show cases [Dumbledore]'s distrust of [Harry] and [Molly] as overprotective.

    I have always wished this were the first of a series.  In this, [James] and [Lily] are able, despite being dead, to induce a dream of what *might be* in [Harry], said dream being the six books covering years two through seven.  The alternate universe kicks in because in this story, trauma causes magical children to mature faster in odd ways.

    I think what I like about this one is that I can see where it
    comes from.  I sincerely believe that [Ron] and his brothers *would*
    have reacted poorly to the idea of [Harry] and [Ginny] dating if
    [Harry] had not utterly surprised them with his show of affecting for
    her after the quidditch match in book six.  I believe the intervention is entirely realistic, as is [Harry]'s response to it.

    I am a bit conflicted on this one.  On one hand, I like the
    stronger [Harry]/[Ginny] interaction.  The amulet induced bond is an
    interesting idea as well.  On the other hand, the premise of the story
    is to minimally extend canon to allow for the stronger relationship.
    In many ways I feel that it fails at that.  I dislike what it did with
    [Hermione], feel that [Ron]'s discovery of the relationship could
    have been done better, and *really* dislike much of the early [Luna]
    arc.

    This is a sweet story that highlights the way that Mrs. Rowling missed the boat in understanding the role love plays in motivating people.  It is a bit spoiled by the harsh note of the killing curse in the last line, but if you ignore the self-hatred implied there, it is excellent.

    I have mixed feelings about this series, and it *is* a series and not a single work published in parts and recollected into one using the series mechanism.  The works vary in size from tiny snippets to full scale novels and *everything* in between, though most are short stories.  I rather strongly dislike Mrs. Rowling's final epilogue, as I think it misunderstands the true nature of forgiveness and indeed *goodness.*  Thus I have issues with Albus Severus as a character.  The other big issue is that the long series of very short stories eventually bogs me down.  There are, however, a few real gems in the collection.
    * _[Grave Days](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3301733)_ - Covering the immediate aftermath of the final battle of the second war.
    * _[Now and Forever](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3904648)_ - The problem with animated artwork is that they have opinions.
