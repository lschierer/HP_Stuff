    In general the idea that [Ron] and [Hermione] are part of some plot to deceive and monitor [Harry] 24/7 is ludicrous.  Children simply are not capable of maintaining that level of deception.  This story however provides a reasonable explanation for the scenario.

    In this story, [Harry] does not trust [Dumbledore] after the revelations at the end of 5th year.  [Lupin] steps up to take an active role in [Harry]'s life, and [Ginny] doesn't date Dean.  One of the notable features of this story is that amulets are made to allow [Ginny] to siphon power from the other [Weasleys].

    This story features [Harry] and [Ginny], but is *really* about the failings of [Dumbledore] and [Lupin].  What would have happened if [Sirius] had not seen the newspaper from [Fudge], but rather died when [Riddle] raided Azkaban?

    In many ways this is how book seven *ought* to have gone.

    This bond story is one of the longer ones.  I really like the way it does [Molly] and [Percy], and their opposition to [Harry] and
    [Ginny].  I dislike some of the other choices the author has made though.  There is a bit of torturing characters to provide angst, and the setup to cause the whole scenario is a bit chaotic.  The author attempted to fix this with a prequel that, I think, actually managed to confuse things more.

    This story ignores the concept of [Horcruxes], and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room in the
    Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like [Harry] as a phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What *really* like is the trunks.

    This story pre-dates [Ginny]'s confidence around [Harry] to
    his time in [Grimmauld Place] rather than the slower and mostly off
    "screen" build-up that we see in the canonical story line.  Here
    [Ginny] convinces and helps [Harry] to prepare for his trial rather
    than rely on [Dumbledore].  This turns out to be for the best, as
    [Lucius] is rather more openly active in this version.  It is
    unfortunate that the author did not develop this concept further.

    This could have gone in the [Time Travel] or [Harry Leaves] sections.  This is one of the stories where [Harry] sends his memories back in time.  Unlike most, this [Harry] decides that he is best off using his memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.

    Despite featuring [Harry] and [Ginny] together, I almost put this one in the [Featuring Hermione] category, as it leans towards [Hermione] as world saviour and [Harry] as *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would prefer a stronger [Ginny].

    Featuring a manipulative but not evil [Dumbledore], and a redeemable [Snape], this one is a super-powered [Harry] story with a bit of a twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

    I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that [Harry] and [Ginny] have met before, and so when [Harry] meets [Ron] on the train, [Ron] stalks off in a huff because he resents being viewed as [Ginny]'s brother (he wants to stand out remember).  This leaves [Harry] feeling very alone, so his wish at the Sorting is for a friend, and thus [Hufflepuff].... and it all flows from there.

    Despite its unfinished state, this is one of my favourite after the battle depictions.  One, I doubt [Mrs. Weasley] came face to face with that particular boggart made real without consequences.  Two, I do not think that [Mrs. Weasley] is ready for [Ginny] to be in a relationship. Yes, in book three they talk about love potions,[^220711-1] but given her over-protective and overbearing nature, I do not think she will be ready for [Ginny] to be in a *serious* romantic relationship until *she* sets said relationship up.  I suspect this remains true even if she would have otherwise approved of said relationship.  I also think that while [Ron] shows a fair amount of character growth across the latter chapters of book seven, he and [Hermione] have a lot further to go than [Harry]. This story gets all these things right.
