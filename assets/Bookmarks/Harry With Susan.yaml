    The biggest flaw with this one is that the author insisted on a redeemed [Draco].  This work is very short, it essentially summarises each year rather than covering each as a full story, but it still manages to feel sufficient. It is nearly entirely fluff, but sometimes that is what I am in the mood for. Because it is a such a short work, it unfortunately develops very few characters.

    This almost but not quite reads as an X-Men crossover.  It is one of the few with this pairing that is not dystopian, but still happens after [Amelia]'s canonical death.

    This one is most noticeable for its first scene and its last scene.  Both make it number among my favourites, despite some less desirable elements.  Most noticeably, I dislike the over the top handling of [Ron], and there are some inconsistencies in a few other places.

    Much of the societal baggage that this story presupposes around magical betrothals, courtship, and contracts is really badly flawed unless one also presupposes that the magical world is, and has been, incredibly misogynistic.  There is some evidence of severe glass ceilings and strict stereotyping in the magical world.  There is also some evidence against it, and logic suggests that magic as presented in the books *should* be an equalizing factor mitigating strongly against *effective* suppression.  As a side note, I think that is why so many fan fiction authors have suggested "family magic" - to create a magically backed patriarchal structure that women can be locked into, and/or threatened with exclusion from.  This also makes the common [Susan] is an orphan mistake, which makes sense for the plot in this AU.

    Interestingly, if you read closely, this work explores some of that tension, a society that has tried to create preasures to conform, but can't quite pull it off, but is more than a bit in denial about how well things are working.
