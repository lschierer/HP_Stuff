    This one has no particular pairing, and avoids names in a few places that is both odd and slightly annoying.  I have never read any of [H. P. Lovecraft]'s works, as I do not in general like horror, but I *am* vaguely familiar with his body of work.  Here [Luna] is descended from the [Marsh Family][MFLC], from [H. P. Lovecraft]'s stories.  When pushed too far one day, that heritage comes outâ€¦
