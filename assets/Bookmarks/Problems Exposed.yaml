    There is a thread of condescension and bigotry that even the supposedly pro-muggle wizard displays that goes unnoticed and unaddressed in cannon.  Here one instance of it is addressed.

    [Harry]'s name coming out of the Goblet of Fire is not *really* satisfactorily explained.  The explanation given opens up all sorts of conclusions.  This is one of the most logical.

    A brutal disection of [Dumbledore]'s inaction disguised as in interview with the Oracle of Delphi.

    I hesitated on how to categorize this.  I'm not a huge fan of the free-form poetry style it is written in, but it mostly works for this one-shot?  Anyway, the story highlights a frequent criticism of the plot, the way [Harry] met the [Weasleys] (though I actually have less of a problem with it than most people).  More importantly, it addresses a truly disturbing anecdote at the start of book three, where [Molly] tells the girls about her past uses of love potions. It does so in the way I find most believable, this is not some grand plot involving *everyone*, but rather its *[Molly]*'s plot, and *most* of her children are simply guilty of not stopping her (I'm okay with the exception it makes).
