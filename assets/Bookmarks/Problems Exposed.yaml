    I *really* want to like this story. The problem is that the author ignores so much that really ought to be obvious to someone calling out the things that this story *does* call out as problematic.
    * This story supposedly takes place after the [Riddle] War, and yet [Lucius] is a school govenor.  I do not understand how people *continously* forget that he was removed at the end of book two.[^250408-1]
    * On a minor note, this story has nine govenors, not twelve.[^250408-2]
    * The author can be forgiven for not including the fact that the wand [Lucius] formerly hid in his cane was shattered in book seven.  The author *probably* had not read book seven when writing this. It is also believable that [Lucius] would replace it with a similar model supposing he is allowed a wand at all.configs:
    * The author uses the common misperception that [Binns] only teaches about [Goblin] rebellions.  We see examples of him teaching about several other subjects in books one and two.[^250408-3]
    * The thoughts on making detention teach something are the sort of mindless drivel I expect out of modern society.  The disipline process at [Hogwarts] *does* need to be looked at, the way it is handled in the books there's a real risk that a student can end up in sufficient detentions that he or she *cannot* both sleep and do his/her school work, leading to ... more detentions. This will quickly spiral out of control.   But that is both a longer rant, and not the same thing as what the author describes. configs:
    * Far more problematatic than any of these examples however, is the fact that while both [McGonagall] and [Flitwick] are called out for their neglect of the students under their charge, [Sprout] is actually *praised* **despite her participation in that abuse** during [Harry]'s fourth year.  Indeed, the idea that [Sprout] objected in any way to the badges used to mock [Harry] that year is laughable.  I mean, [McGonagall] and [Flitwick] *do* **need** to be called out, and for more or less precisely the reasons the author gives. That is why I *want* to like this story so much.  It is one of the few that *does* call them to task so precisely without crossing over into bashing.  I just wish it had finished the job.

    There is a thread of condescension and bigotry that even the supposedly pro-muggle wizard displays that goes unnoticed and unaddressed in cannon.  Here one instance of it is addressed.

    [Harry]'s name coming out of the Goblet of Fire is not *really* satisfactorily explained.  The explanation given opens up all sorts of conclusions.  This is one of the most logical.

    A brutal disection of [Dumbledore]'s inaction disguised as in interview with the Oracle of Delphi.

    I hesitated on how to categorize this.  I'm not a huge fan of the free-form poetry style it is written in, but it mostly works for this one-shot?  Anyway, the story highlights a frequent criticism of the plot, the way [Harry] met the [Weasleys] (though I actually have less of a problem with it than most people).  More importantly, it addresses a truly disturbing anecdote at the start of book three, where [Molly] tells the girls about her past uses of love potions. It does so in the way I find most believable, this is not some grand plot involving *everyone*, but rather its *[Molly]*'s plot, and *most* of her children are simply guilty of not stopping her (I'm okay with the exception it makes).
