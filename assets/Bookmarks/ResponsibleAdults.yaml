    This is a series of one-shots, so it is tempting to bookmark
    individual chapters.  The first chapter features a responsible Poppy
    Pomphrey taking Hagrid to task over the dragon.  Some of the following
    chapters are simply silly, but chapter 5 is mildly interesting, and 6-7
    have some interesting nuggets in them.  Chapter 8 is a disturbing might
    have been.

    This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
    [Dursleys] looking back and explaining to a younger relative how it is
    that he, and the rest of the neighbourhood, came to overlook [Harry]'s
    living situation.  It then enters the Responsible Adult alternate universe
    by positing that people might have realised that Petunia was lying about
    [Harry]'s secondary schooling and treated him like a missing child.
    This story is noteworthy because prior to reading this, despite the fact
    that I am, or ought to be (based on my own rants on the topic), fully
    aware of just how caste based English society can be, I had overlooked
    just how effective [Petunia]'s lies would have been to that audience.

    What would happen if someone saw [Harry] between when he was
    left in the basket outside the [Dursleys] and when [Petunia] found him the
    next morning?  While most people who stay in the magical world may not
    have an ounce of logic, not all *do* stay, and one woman without magic can
    do more that most magicals expect anyway.

    This one features an out of character [Snape].  I am unsure
    how much of his speech patterns are an affectation of the role he is
    playing, and how much is the author's interpretation of the character.  If
    the former, it is brilliant, if the latter, it is a flaw.  It would
    require a second chapter were we see [Snape] talking to others to begin to
    figure out which is going on though.  What makes this one memorable is the
    back and forth between [Snape] and [Petunia], with [McGonagall]'s
    introspection interspersed.  [Petunia] does a masterful job of *destroying*
    [Dumbledore] and [McGonagall], only to be equally *destroyed* by [Snape].
    Meanwhile [McGonagall] shows that underneath all that tarnish there
    really is some silver by realising that much of what is happening is
    deserved on all sides.

    Considering British Common Law does not have a concept of
    Emancipated Minors, I rather doubt that either Wizarding Law or Goblin
    law does.[^221214-2]  Other than that Americanism, much of this work is
    a very much needed critical look of what would happen if the non-magical
    world actually *did* decide to intervene in the Harry Potter books.
    Overall, I suspect it is reasonably accurate.

    What if [Vernon] and [Petunia] *didn't* hide the letter, and thus
    [Hagrid] *wasn't* [Harry]'s first introduction to magic?  In this story,
    Tom the bar keep is that introduction, just as the Leaky Cauldron
    officially opens.  [Hufflepuff] [Harry] spends the year keeping his head
    down and isolated from the rest of the school, only to be suddenly
    attacked by [Riddle]'s wraith at the end of the year.  As a [Hufflepuff],
    he has rather more of a support network than as a [Gryffindor].  This really
    should have been developed at least a chapter or two further.  Some key
    things are left unanswered, but it is an intriguing start unfortunately
    marked complete.

    Similar in some ways to _[The Boy Who Never Knew]_, this
    story also features a [Hufflepuff] version of [Harry] whose abuse
    is discovered because of his sorting into that house.

    This is one of several works by this author in which [Vernon]
    directly or indirectly pushes for [Sirius] to have a trial as a means
    of getting rid of [Harry].  I include in it in this section because
    he is, whatever his motives, forcing the other adults to act
    responsibly, however unwillingly they do so.

    I am reluctantly putting this story into this category.  While
    the story features a number of incredibly irresponsible adults,
    ultimately [Hermione] is, although I doubt she realises it, able to
    succeed because she ends up in the care of a few who do, for a variety
    of reasons, take some level of responsibility.  The most interesting
    things about this story is the detailed thought that has gone into
    addressing both [Hermione] as a flawed character and the wizarding
    culture into which she enters.  While I dislike a few of the author's
    decisions, I *really* like some of the author's ideas on the culture,
    and the honest look at [Hermione] is refreshing, especially for an
    author who features her so prominently.

    [Legally Blonde] might have been made for a Harry Potter crossover.
    A lawyer who cannot quite fit in totally fits in with the way Mrs.
    Rowling depicts wizards as being unable to quite grasp non-magical
    fashion.   The contrast between [Elle Woods] and [Umbridge] is
    incredibly funny.  I have seen this tried a few other times,[^lbcx]
    but none do it quite so well.

    This is yet another collection of one-shots.  In fact, several
    one-shots per chapter.  The first snippet in Chapter 1 is … unlikely.
    [McGonagall] will not be proactive that way.  The second is better.
    The third is an awesome AU.  The one marked "5" in Chapter 2 shows what
    it would take to redeem [Lupin] as a character.  The one marked "6" is
    what I would *like* to see in a [Goblet of Fire] fan fiction.  Too often
    these involve bashing characters instead.  "7" in Chapter 3"
    demonstrates exactly what is wrong with [Snape]'s obsession with
    [Lily].  #s 8-10 are effectively a single work.  It shows a redeemed
    [Sirius].  #12 (Chapter 4) shows a redeemed [Sprout].  #13 is
    fatally flawed - though it shows why [Snape] could not have delayed
    his return, by showing what would have happened had he done so.

    I dislike the way the choice of title and some of the handling of
    the first scenes legitimises [Harry]'s choice in this, but it is for the
    time after he leaves non-magical care that I am noting this story.  The
    idea that a few adults merely needed a slight push to rock them off of
    dead centre is an interesting one.  I think the author did reasonably but
    not great with [Neville] and his grandmother.  There are hints of the
    transition that would have taken place with the tutor offsetting the
    negative influences in young [Neville]'s life.

    My personal theory is that [Azkaban] truly messed with
    [Sirius]' brain, and that the man we meet in the books is not at
    all the man he was before them.  That being said, he is *rarely*
    given a fair representation in fan fiction, and it is nice to
    see a different take for once.

    This story has a number of thought provoking elements, but
    is ultimately fairly obviously establishing an alternate universe.
    * In this story, soul magic is inherently dangerous, society knows
      this, but did not know [Riddle] was using such magic until too late.
    * It is strongly implied that the Death Eaters made magically binding
      oaths to [Riddle] that oblige their obedience.  Many of their children
      are aware their family members regret these oaths.
    * Society has responded by adding a class on Magical Theory to
      [Hogwarts].  This puts a very different slant on the [Slytherin] students, which the author has used to different degrees in different particular students.
    * There are some inconsistencies in its definitions of magical
      classification.  This may be because the book admits that knowledge
      is generally hoarded and not shared, as research requires for success.
    * Magical mind healing is considered a real profession in this work.

    I dislike dealing with incomplete works, authors too frequently abandon and/or remove them.  I am doing so because this one, as I re-read it, is so incredibly typical of a pattern that irks me, so much so that I am unsure why I subscribed to the story.  I see much promise in it, but the flaws are quite disastrous.  I ended up writing quite the rant about it [here][egoist].

    Beyond those, like many books that want a redeemed [Snape], it ends up bashing [James]. All and all, I am persisting in the re-read trying to find out why I have not unsubscribed in the past. While it is great to see [Bill] step up, and there are indications a few other characters will as well, the flaws are getting really hard to swallow.

    This is another that assumes that [Amelia] is a competent adult.  I admit its a tempting departure point since [Riddle] *does* in fact kill her off fairly early after his return.  This work features a redeemable [Snape], which isn't my favourite.  There is a semi-reasonable attempt to make it plausible.  It is ... semi-reasonable. It features fairly reasonable [Ron] bashing, and almost but not quite over the top [Molly] and [Dumbledore] bashing.  Of particular note is that the premise for [Dumbledore]'s actions is more thought out than most bashing works.

    This one takes two minor plot points.
    * [Riddle] wanted to teach as far back as graduating from [Hogwarts].  If
      that was in fact a *real* desire, and not a fake ambition, he might have a *small* scrap of humanity.  This assumes he does.  Children are to be educated.  If they must be killed, unless they are [Harry], it is to be done rapidly and painlessly.  Thus [Riddle] takes offence at [Umbridge]'s actions (because she harms all students).
    * [Amelia] is *actually* as honest and hard working as [Arthur] claims.

    While I think the first plot deviation ... unlikely, it is *possible* and an interesting theory.  The second plot point is *desirable* but, unfortunately, she is *actually* a [typical adult].  a [later work in the same series] shows an earlier plot departure point that would have occurred were she *actually* responsible.
