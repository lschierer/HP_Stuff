    This is a series of one-shots, so it is tempting to bookmark
    individual chapters.  The first chapter features a responsible Poppy
    Pomphrey taking Hagrid to task over the dragon.  Some of the following
    chapters are simply silly, but chapter 5 is mildly interesting, and 6-7
    have some interesting nuggets in them.  Chapter 8 is a disturbing might
    have been.

    This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
    [Dursleys] looking back and explaining to a younger relative how it is
    that he, and the rest of the neighbourhood, came to overlook [Harry]'s
    living situation.  It then enters the Responsible Adult alternate universe
    by positing that people might have realised that Petunia was lying about
    [Harry]'s secondary schooling and treated him like a missing child.
    This story is noteworthy because prior to reading this, despite the fact
    that I am, or ought to be (based on my own rants on the topic), fully
    aware of just how caste based English society can be, I had overlooked
    just how effective [Petunia]'s lies would have been to that audience.
