    [Snape]'s relationship with [Lily] has never been a healthy one. [Lily] has always known this at some level.

    Originally published on [Fanfiction.net].  This unfinished story is as much about the relationship between [Lily] and [James] as it is about about [Lily] and [Snape], covering as it does the many unfounded assumptions that now pass almost as cannon surrounding their generation's school years.
