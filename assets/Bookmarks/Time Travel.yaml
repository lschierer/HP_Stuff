    [Ginny], [Ron], and [Hermione] are allowed to see key
    scenes from [Harry]'s past. But are these just visions, or can they
    change the future?  This story departs from much of what happened in
    books six and seven. It assumes that [Dumbledore] and his allies
    *did* train [Harry], secretly, and that training was just as brutal
    and inhumane, in its own way, as his early life. Unlike the epilogue
    of the real book seven, this story shows a real relationship between
    [Harry] and [Ginny], and realistically named children result.

    [Harry] spends a few days as a student in his parents' seventh year just after wining the canonical battle.  He reveals very little while he is back there, but is responsible for encouraging [Lily] to reevaluate her relationships, and [Dumbledore] to trust the prophesy.

    [Ron] dies in [Gringotts], [Ginny] and [Hermione] in the battle of [Hogwarts].  [Harry] has to flee after retrieving the Diadem but before
    obtaining the means to destroy it.  He eventually learns everything he needs to win, but England is gone.  He goes back and time, quite insane. The Sorting Hat reluctantly allows him to change future history.

    For any given filter, no matter how reasonable, there is an
    exception.  I am not usually a fan of pairing [Hermione] with random
    adults.  However, a time traveller who remains in her adult body
    interacting with other adult characters lacks much of the creepy factor
    that makes that so objectionable.  This work features the many-worlds
    theory of time travel.  I admit I prefer the approach where you actually
    change the past and thus, if you can return, the present you return to.
    That being said, there is much that is well done in this story.  Of
    particular note, it is said at multiple points that [Riddle] probably
    intended to create his final [horcrux] with [Harry]'s death.  What
    artefact did he intend to use?

    This is a fairly unique take on time travel.  [Harry] causes *everyone* to go back, but only for one hour.

    The most unfortunate thing in this one is that the authors decided not to actually mess with future time.  That aside, its a fun trip through the past as the group deals with the stress of being out of time, and [Harry] and [Ginny] grow close earlier than the original.

    I do not often like either redeemed [Snape] nor books with
    Albus Severus, and this book and its sequel contain both.  Despite that,
    I do enjoy it.  This book has one plot element that I particularly like,
    [Harry] crafts runes that amplify the power of the sacrifice he makes when he allows [Riddle] to kill him.

    Despite its age, I only recently came across this from another reader's recommendations.  It is very well done.  The author correctly introduces some concern with the concept of the time traveller dating now inhabiting the body of his younger self.  This is not, unfortunately, fully resolved.  There is a conversation with [Luna] that I suspect is *intended* to do so, but does not fully satisfy.  I also would have liked to see a post-[Riddle] conversation with [Dumbledore], but that also was not included. Overall though, I am satisfied, there is a "I succeeded and the future is unknown" feel to the ending that is appropriate. configs:
