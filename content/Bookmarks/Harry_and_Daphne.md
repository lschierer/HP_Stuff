[Daphne]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Greengrass/Daphne" >}}) is one of those
blank slate characters that authors can do anything with.  Sure enough, they
certainly have, though there do tend to be patterns.  Most of them are not worth
reading, but enough are that this becomes a category to watch.

    * Comments: This story and its sequel are enough to make you interested in
      this pairing no matter what else you might otherwise think.  Daphne is
      believable, Ginny is reasonably well done, the only real change is that
      Harry has caught on to the fact that Dumbledore is not to be trusted early
      on in sixth year.  Everything flows from that.

    * Comments: Featuring a slightly super-powered Harry, this one also features
      a believable Daphne, and in some ways a better Ginny than _the Importance
      of Intent_.  The super power deviation is presented in a way that makes it
      a logical branch point from the original books, and does not badly
      detract, but overall the Harry in this one is somewhat less believable.
