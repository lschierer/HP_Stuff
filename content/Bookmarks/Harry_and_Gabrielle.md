This pairing has to be *very* carefully handled to not simply come across as
creepy.  While no one blinks at a five year age gap between people in their
thirties, even a two year age gap will get a second look when dealing with high
school students.  While we do not know how old [Gabrielle][] is with any true
certainty, it is safe to say that she is way too young for fourteen year old
[Harry][] when they first meet.

    * Comments: This story handles the age gap in two ways: 
      1. They do not get together until some time has passed.
      1. The gap is a problem for [Harry][], but magic is not always kind, nor
	 always able to be undone.

    * Comments: This handles the age gap because, through no fault of either
      party, [Harry][] has been in magical stasis for sufficient time that
      there no longer *is* an age gap.
