While [Ginny]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Weasley/Ginevra_Molly" >}}) has flaws,
I remain partial to this pairing.  Unfortunately fan fiction rarely does it
justice.

   * Comments: In general the idea that Ron and Hermione are part of some plot
     to deceive and monitor Harry 24/7 is ludicrous.  Children simply are not
     capable of maintaining that level of deception.  This story however
     provides a reasonable explanation for the scenario.

   * Comments: In this story, Harry does not trust Dumbledore after the
     revelations at the end of 5th year.  Remus steps up to take an active role
     in Harry's life, and Ginny doesn't date Dean.  One of the notable features
     of this story is that amulets are made to allow Ginny to siphon power from
     the other Weasleys.

   * Comments: This story features Harry and Ginny, but is *really* about the
     failings of Dumbledore and Lupin.  What would have happened if Sirius had
     not seen the newspaper from Fudge, but rather died when Riddle raided
     Azkaban?

    * Comments: This bond story is one of the longer ones.  I really like the
      way it does Molly and Percy, and their opposition to Harry and Ginny.  I
      dislike some of the other choices the author has made though.  There is a
      bit of torturing characters to provide angst, and the setup to cause the
      whole scenario is a bit chaotic.  The author attempted to fix this with a
      prequel that, I think, actually managed to confuse things more.  

_[Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2456938)_
:   * Author: Ophiuchus
    * Published: 2005-06-27. Updated: 2005-08-07. 
    * Comments: This story ignores the concept of [Horcruxes][],
      and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room
      in the Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
      trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like Harry as a
      phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like
      is the trunks.

    * Comments: This story pre-dates [Ginny]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Weasley/Ginevra_Molly" >}})'s 
      confidence around [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}}) 
      to his time in [Grimmauld Place]({{< ref "Harrypedia/Grimmauld_Place" >}}) 
      rather than the slower and mostly off "screen" build-up that we see in
      the canonical story line.  Here Ginny convinces and helps Harry to
      prepare for his trial rather than rely on [Dumbledore][HpediaD1].
      This turns out to be for the best, as [Lucius][]
      is rather more openly active in this version.  It is unfortunate that the
      author did not develop this concept further.

:   * Author: Hippothestrowl 
    * Published: 2022-02-17. Updated: 2022-03-17.
    * Comments: This is one of the stories where Harry sends his memories back
      in time.  Unlike most, this Harry decides that he is best off using his
      memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.

    * Published: 2012-07-16. Updated: 2012-12-19.
    * Comments: This really focuses more on Ron and [Hermione][] than it does on
      Harry and Ginny, and is one of the stories that, while sticking with
      canonical couples, leans towards [Hermione][] as world saviour and Harry as
      *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would
      prefer a stronger Ginny. 

_[Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746)_
:   * Author: hermyd
    * Published: 2009-08-02. Updated: 2010-09-07. 
    * Comments: Featuring a Manipulative but not evil Dumbledore, and a
      redeemable Snape, this one is a super-powered Harry story with a bit of a
      twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

_[A Romance In Reverse](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12413357)_
:   * Author: DukeBrymin
    * Published: 2017-03-20
    * Comments: I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this
      one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written
      in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it
      fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that Harry and Ginny have met
      before, and so when Harry meets Ron on the train, Ron stalks off in a huff
      because he resents being viewed as Ginny's brother (he wants to stand out
      remember).  This leaves Harry feeling very alone, so his wish at the
      Sorting is for a friend, and thus Hufflepuff.... and it all flows from
      there.

    * Comments: Despite its unfinished state, this is one of my favourite after
      the battle depictions.  One, I doubt Mrs. Weasley came face to face with
      that particular boggart made real without consequences.  Two, I do not
      think that Mrs. Weasley is ready for Ginny to be in a relationship.  Yes,
      in book three they talk about love potions,[^220711-1] but given her
      over-protective and overbearing nature, I do not think she will be ready
      for Ginny to be in a *serious* romantic relationship until *she* sets
      said relationship up.  I suspect this remains true even if she would have
      otherwise approved of said relationship.  I also think that while Ron
      shows a fair amount of character growth across the latter chapters of
      book seven, he and [Hermione][] have a lot further to go than Harry.  This
      story gets all these things right.

    * Comments: also unfortunately unfinished, this story is another great
      example of Harry and Ginny's mutually supporting relationship.  This one
      is AU in that they get together sooner, and Umbridge is able to expel
      them.  This also show cases [Dumbledore][D2]'s distrust of [Harry]({{< relref "Harry_James" >}}) 
      and [Molly]({{< relref "Molly" >}}) as overprotective.

    * Comments: Yet another work by this author, this one has the premise that
      [Hermione][H1] does not actually get along with [Ginny][G1], and that
      [Percy][PW1] is not any more happy with his family's association with
      [Harry][HP1] after the war than he was during it.

    * Comments: This short and entirely alternate universe work is amusing.
      [Harry][] has magiced himself *out of his body* and [Ginny][] decides to
      take him in for no real reason?  Totally doesn't make much sense, but
      highly amusing.

    * Comments: I have always wished this were the first of a series.  In this,
      [James][] and [Lily][] are able, despite being dead, to induce a dream of
      what *might be* in [Harry][], said dream being the six books covering
      years two through seven.  The alternate universe kicks in because in this
      story, trama causes magical children to mature faster in odd ways.
