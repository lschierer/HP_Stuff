I am not often a fan of [Hermione]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Granger/Hermione_Jean" >}}) 
as a romantic partner for [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}}).  
That being said, occasionally you come across one that, despite the pairing, is
incredibly well done.

    * Comments: Harry starts dating Hermione in the time-gap between Halloween and the first
    task of the TriWizard Tournament.  He discovers that Dumbledore could have
    declared the initial champion selection invalid, and that the Goblet of Fire
    is much more powerful than most people want to admit.
