Many of these stories happen when [Amelia][] Bones steps in to, you know,
actually do her job as a law enforcement official, and thus belong in the
[Responsible Adult][] category.  This page is focused on those that do not.

    * Comments: This almost but not quite reads as an X-Men crossover.  It is
      one of the few with this pairing that is not dystopian, but still happens
      after [Amelia][AB1]'s canonical death.
