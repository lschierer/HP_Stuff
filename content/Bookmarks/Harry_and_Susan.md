Many of these stories happen when [Amelia][] Bones steps in to, you know,
actually do her job as a law enforcement official, and thus belong in the
[Responsible Adult][] category.  This page is focused on those that do not.

    * Comments: This almost but not quite reads as an X-Men crossover.  It is
      one of the few with this pairing that is not dystopian, but still happens
      after [Amelia][AB1]'s canonical death.

    * Comments: This one is most noticeable for its first scene and its last
      scene.  Both make it number among my favourites, despite some less
      desirable elements.  Most noticeably, I dislike the over the top handling
      of [Ron][], and there are some inconsistencies in a few other places.
