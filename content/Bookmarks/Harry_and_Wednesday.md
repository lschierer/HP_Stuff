Harry Potter almost begs for a crossover with the Addams family, despite the
differences in timelines in any iteration of the Addams family.  If you are
going to do such a crossover, pairing Harry with Wednesday is, or should be, a
foregone conclusion.  Some of these stories are just stupid, slash and similar
themes abound, despite the fact that it is entirely unnecessary, and, frankly,
contrary to the original Addams source material. Despite that, there are some
real gems, some of which are even finished.

    * Comments: This actually has a ton of crossovers, and I expect I would
      enjoy it more if I could follow more of them.  The pairing comes at the
      end, and is rather a capstone to the work.  Despite that, I think it fits
      in this category, because it *feels* like an Addams story.
