So often children's literature is possible because the adults in those stories
are incompetent.  Sometimes they are well-meaning, sometimes they are not,
sometimes they are *trying* and failing, other times they are effectively
negligent.  Sometimes they are simply effectively absent.  Irregardless, the
story is only possible because children are doing things that adults should
have taken care of.  The Harry Potter series is no exception, though it differs
from many in that it features adults in *all* of these categories.  

This is a collection of fan fiction stories that are note-worthy primarily
because they showcase some aspect of adults being â€¦ adults.

    * Comments:  This is a series of one-shots, so it is tempting to bookmark
      individual chapters.  The first chapter features a responsible Poppy
      Pomphrey taking Hagrid to task over the dragon.  Some of the following
      chapters are simply silly, but chapter 5 is mildly interesting, and 6-7
      have some interesting nuggets in them.  Chapter 8 is a disturbing might
      have been.

    * Comments: This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
      [Dursleys]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Dursley" >}}) looking back and
      explaining to a younger relative how it is that he, and the rest of the
      neighbourhood, came to overlook [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}})'s 
      living situation.  It then enters the Responsible Adult alternate
      universe by positing that people might have realised that Petunia was
      lying about [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}})'s 
      secondary schooling and treated him like a missing child.  This story is
      noteworthy because prior to reading this, despite the fact that I am, or
      ought to be (based on my own rants on the topic), fully aware of just how
      caste based English society can be, I had overlooked just how effective
      Petunia's lies would have been to that audience.

      between when he was left in the basket outside the [Dursleys]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Dursley" >}})
      and when Petunia found him the next morning?  While most people who stay
      in the magical world may not have an ounce of logic, not all *do* stay,
      and one woman without magic can do more that most magicals expect anyway.

    * Comments: In this story a [basilisk]({{< ref "Harrypedia/animals/basilisk" >}}) 
      is treated as a weapon of mass destruction.  There are mandatory
      procedures in place that are actually followed.

    * Comments: What if Vernon and Petunia *didn't* hide the letter, and thus
      Hagrid *wasn't* [Harry]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James" >}})'s 
      first introduction to magic?  In this story, Tom the bar keep is that
      introduction, just as the Leaky Cauldron officially opens.  Hufflepuff
      Harry spends the year keeping his head down and isolated from the rest of
      the school, only to be suddenly attacked by [Riddle]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Riddle/Tom_Marvolo" >}})'s 
      wraith at the end of the year.  As a Hufflepuff, he has rather more of a
      support network than as a Gryffindor.  This really should have been
      developed at least a chapter or two further.  Some key things are left
      unanswered, but it is an intriguing start unfortunately marked complete.

    * Comments: This one features an out of character
      [Snape]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/Snape/Severus" >}}).  I am unsure how
      much of his speech patterns are an affectation of the role he is playing,
      and how much is the author's interpretation of the character.  If the
      former, it is brilliant, if the latter, it is a flaw.  It would require a
      second chapter were we see Snape talking to others to begin to figure out
      which is going on though.  What makes this one memorable is the back and
      forth between Snape and Petunia, with [McGonagall]({{< ref "Harrypedia/people/McGonagall/Minerva" >}})'s 
      introspection interspersed.  Petunia does a masterful job of *destroying*
      [Dumbledore][HpediaD1] and McGonagall, only to be equally *destroyed* by
      Snape.  Meanwhile McGonagall shows that underneath all that tarnish there
      really is some silver by realising that much of what is happening is
      deserved on all sides.

      * Comments: Considering British Common Law does not have a concept of
        Emancipated Minors, I rather doubt that either Wizarding Law or Goblin
        law does.[^221214-2]  Other than that Americanism, much of this work is
        a very much needed critical look of what would happen if the non-magical
        world actually *did* decide to intervene in the Harry Potter books.
        Overall, I suspect it is reasonably accurate.
