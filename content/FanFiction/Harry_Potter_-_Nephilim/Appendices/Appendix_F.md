As I state in [Points of Divergence][AA], Mrs. Rowling has set up a world in
which magical contracts exist, and in which they can have unwilling
participants.   This has been explored in a number of other fan fiction
works,[^230103-2] and I do not want to rehash them.  I am thus going to define
magical contracts rather more than Mrs. Rowling did.

First of all, the word "contract" is rather misleading.  The so called
Unbreakable Vow is not *really* a contract, but clearly falls in this category.
These are contracts in the sense that at least one party agrees to do or be
something to, for, or with the other party, possibly, but not necessarily, in
exchange for something. 

## Who can enter 

Contracts can be agreed to by proxy.  Your proxy must be related to you 
* with an imbalanced power relationship
  * a parent can agree for a child
  * a child cannot agree for a parent
  * a sibling cannot agree for a sibling
* by straight line inheritance
  * your direct ancestors
  * but not your aunts, uncles, great-aunts, great-uncles, so on. 
  * Not a cousin even if he/she belongs to an older generation (once or more removed situations). 
* *or* by a formally recognised *delegated* parental authority.
  * this relationship must be recognised by *both sides*
  * teachers have authority delegated to them by parents for example.
    * the limits of a teacher acting in loco parientis are poorly defined
    * except that a parent can overrule or override said teacher's decisions. 
  * government officials have authority delegated to them only to the extent they are a legitimate government.
    * I might successfully rebel against a contract foisted on me by a government official if *all* of the following are true:
      * I *honestly and sincerely* believe the contract unjust
      * I *honestly and sincerely* believe the government corrupt, illegitimate, or simply not mine. 
    * A government contract might fail to bind similarly if *any* of the following are true
      * the government official binding me is knowingly acting in excess of his/her authority
      * the government official binding me is knowingly acting on a bribe
      * the government official binding me is knowingly violating the law of the land in any of
        * the nature of the contract
        * the method of binding me
        * the reason for binding me
* A contract by a proxy cannot force you to commit mortal sin. See below. 

Contracts can be implicitly agreed to.  Harry, but walking to the front of the
hall, joining the other champions in the side room, and staying for the
directions to the first tasks, implicitly accepted that he was in fact a
TriWizard contestant.   This may or may not matter for that particular case 
(see above about delegated parental authority) in the canon books, but I am 
going to assume it does matter magically in the general case.  

## Restrictions

Contracts need not be written on special paper, but they must be formal
agreements in some way.  There are many ways to formalise an agreement.  Common
ones include, but are not limited to:
* full legal signature on a paper (or parchment) contract
* formal statement of agreement "I, <name>, agree to xyz"
* repeated statements of agreement using significant numbers in short durations.
  * uses of three and seven
* acting as if bound to the contract (ie common law marriage) for either
  magically significant durations or contractually significant events/actions
  that are distinctly related to contract and clearly not part of your
  non-contract/pre-contract normal life
  * marriages are consummated
  * the TriWizard champions processed out of the room
  * engagement rings
  * being sorted by the Sorting Hat

Contracts do *something*.  Person A agrees to do something or be something 
for Person B.  The contract may or may not be one sided.  The contract may or 
may not have penalties.

## Effects 

Contracts cannot force you to do something the way the [Imperius][] curse does.
Rather, it forces behaviour through the existence of penalties.  You can break
an "Unbreakable Vow" but you die as a result.  When a secret keeper "contracts"
to keep a secret, in a sense _everyone else_ is bound not to know something
yes.  But I think that's why James and Lily had to go to the cottage in
Godric's Hollow.  They had to go to a house that was *not* known to be theirs
to hide the location of their house.  Otherwise the widespread knowledge of
their home's location by those who did not consent to have said location hidden
would have prevented the spell. 

Thus for this work the limitation on the Fidelius Charm is that the knowledge
being hidden be known only by those who are either casting the spell or consent
to the spell's casting.  I know that many other works have other limitations
instead.   So the key secret would have been that *the Potters lived there* and
the house's physical presence would have been accidentally hidden because to
see the house would (potentially) betray the secret.  In other words, the most
visible effect as described in the books of putting Grimmauld Place under
the Fidelius Charm (the way it pops into existence when you learn the secret)
is an accidental side effect of the magic, and not the true operative bit of
the spell.  This also explains why the spell broke at the cottage, when it
ceased to be the Potter's home, the spell broke and the cottage was revealed to
everyone not just those whom Pettigrew had told.

Contracts *can* force you *feel* things.  Your emotions are just chemical
effects, a contract can make you unnaturally happy or sad, incite or suppress
physical attraction, make you hungry or nauseous, so on.  A contract can also
cause a coma or prevent restful sleep, as these are also physical reactions and
do not (directly) involve the will.  However, a contract is not going to (for
example) magically transport you like a port key.[^230103-3]

A nephil entered into a marriage contract then could be coerced to be faithful
by magically suppressing his/her physical reactions to anyone except the
intended spouse.  This would not force you to actually go through with the
marriage, but would provide a strong incentive to do so.  A stronger contract
might make you physically ill or even die if you failed to go through with the
marriage.

## Implications

### Marriage 

The Church has had to figure out how to deal with nephil caught in such
contracts.  What do you do when you validly marry someone in the Church, then
your non-Catholic parent contracts you to someone else with a death clause?
Obviously you cannot have a *real* wedding to a second spouse, but are you
mortally sinning to fulfil the contract to preserve your life?   It seems clear
that your free will is compromised.  What about lesser penalties?  How much of
a penalty can a nephil be expected to endure before we consider his/her free
will compromised?  What if the contract pre-existed the valid marriage, is that
grounds for an annulment?  Would that be true only if one or both parties knew
of the contract?  What if the married nephil, through careless words or
actions, enters him/herself into a marriage contract, or worse, more than one?  

Does it matter if it is not a matter of lack of care, but rather a matter of
failure to understand that such a contract is possible?   Consider the case of
a nephil whose parents had so little power that they appeared to be normal
humans, say for three or four generations.  Now, through some [chance of
inheritance][ac], you get someone like Hermione.  She has never been taught
that a magical contract is possible, if she were to verbally accept one, or
(again) worse two, is she morally culpable if she feels constrained to make
compromises to meet the demands she has unknowingly bound herself to?  

Sure we all know not to lie, but there is a difference between not lying and
understanding that your words can have permanent unalterable affects that bind
your health and psyche for life.   You would be far more careful about agreeing
to something half heard while you focus on the book you are reading, or signing
something unread.

### Debt

This is the other very interesting situation that leads to all sorts of wierd societal
issues.  Alice accepts, in some formal way, that she owes Bob.  This can be thought of 
in one of two ways, either of which *can* lead to a magical contract.  Alice has 
agreed *to be* in a state of debt until x occurs or alternately, Alice has agreed
to pay Bob back.  The first is a contract to be something, the second a contract to
do something.  If the debt *can be paid*, well and good.  Alice pays her debt, and
is free of the contract.  

However, what if the debt cannot be paid?  If Alice owes her life, or the life of her
child (in extreme but still realistic cases)?  Or in less extreme cases, what if she
simply owes more money than she can earn while keeping herself alive?  

Because these are unstated contracts, if they form at all, they form *because of* 
expectations that the nephil themselves have formed over the centuries.  Some of these
date back to times and places like the Roman Empire where debt slavery was a common legal
practice.  While the laws of the societies that the nephil live in have changed, the 
nephil have come to expect that magic can and does create these contracts for these 
situations.  The terms of these contracts then are set unconsciously by the principles, 
in accord with these norms passed down as part of the body of folk lore, legend, history, and myth that
they are raised with.

This kind of contract thus operates somewhat differently from other formal contracts
that a nephil might carelessly or unwittingly enter into.  Someone like Hermione, raised
with no thought of slavery, would be incapable of unconsciously binding herself into
slavery by accepting a debt.  Someone like Draco, whose family lore is filled with 
stories of using debts in precisely this manner, is actually himself at greater risk 
of being so bound.  A family like the Weasleys would fall somewhere in the middle.

Lastly, children, because they are more absolute in their thinking, more accepting of 
the idea that anything is possible, are more easily bound this way than adults.  Thus 
nephil societies almost universally have a tendency to isolate their children from all 
but the most trusted of friends and relations.  A nephil child aware of his/her 
heritage will frequently grow up knowing only his/her own extended family and one or 
two other families until it is time to enter an apprenticeship, join a magical 
secondary school (such as Hogwarts), or (if home schooled) join the workforce as an 
adult.

Note this does not always lead to slavery.  It can also lead to what some call 
Spontaneous Magical Marriage, a form of marriage contract in which both parties may or 
may not have any power imbalance at all, but which old nephil families have learned, 
generally the hard way, usually caries particularly harsh penalties.  For my purposes 
it is because of such a SMM event that the Black family allowed the marriage of Pollux 
Black to Irma Crabbe at 13 years old.[^230711-1]  These two families with their history
of dark dealings neither one wanted to risk the penalties that the children may have
made themselves liable to.
