## historical origin of the nephilim

This section is pure AU fiction unique to this work.

For my purposes, remember that per [Appendix A] a nephil is a descendant of the union
of a human and a fallen angel.  What was the angel's motives in this?  I am of course
building off of the more supernatural interpretation of the concept of nephilim that
some biblical scholars have proposed.[^230714-1]  But remember, we are also building off
of _[Many Waters][MW]_.  So, with those thoughts in mind, let's build a story around
this.

The basic premise is that the fallen angels wanted to mock God.  They are unable to
create from nothing as God does, so they are limited in what they can do.  They
take themselves, and they take humanity as their 'base material' and *make* (not
*create*) something of this 'material' but call the result their 'creation'.

* They are mocking God in that they have created something visually indistinguishable
  from man, the centrepiece of His creation.
* They are mocking God in that by giving their 'creation' some of their own abilities
  and powers, they claim to have created something superior to God's creation.  As we
  have seen, they failed: the nephilim have less free will than either humanity or
  angels because their being contains some of the limitations of each. They retain
  some of the inability to change that an angel has, residing at once in a being that
  is susceptible *to* change.
* They are mocking God by mocking marriage, in which humanity in a symbolic way
  mirrors the inner life of the Trinity, and thus God himself.  See below in the
  Marriage and debt sections for details. Here they fail only in part.  They do
  succeed in creating a being that, because it can be forced into relationship,
  can only conditionally give self to self.  The Nephilim struggle to make a total,
  free, faithful, and fruitful gift of self.  It is possible for magic to be used on
  them, or even accidentally by them, in ways that would violate any or all of these
  conditions.  However the unfallen angels did not simply sit back and allow this to
  happen entirely unchallenged.
* The fallen angels desired to make their mockery still more complete.  Unfallen angels
  intervened to ensure
    * that ensure the restrictions on [magical contracts] exist.
    * that the angelic nature's tendency to the absolute and the permanent does not prevent
      the nephilim, who exist within time, from experiencing free will.
    * that the abuse of the angelic power comes with equally magical consequences
      * See my notes below on on Free Will, angels do not always act wisely here however well-intentioned.
      * Angels have had to intervene to correct their own mistakes (not sins, honest mistakes)
    * that these consequences tend to self limit abuses across generations
      * so that free will is preserved
      * so that justice is served
      * so that redemption is both possible and desirable to each generation
    * many other ways that frequently *appear* arbitrary and/or capricious - see again that point about not always being wise.

Modern nephilim are the result of very mixed heritage, and thus have a wide variety 
of the powers defined in [Appendix B].  *In a first generation nephil, that is not 
so.*  Such a nephil has powers stemming from only one kind of angel.  Thus (for example) 
'contracts' can affect these nephilim in only very narrow ways.  The fallen angels, being angels, 
perfectly understand future implications of present states.  The hybrid nephilim are 
in fact the intended mockery, the first generation ones were and are a means to that end.

## Free Will

Because I am starting with _[Many Waters][MW]_ as one of my base sources for material, I feel somewhat
constrained by the choices made in that work.  It also happens that being so constrained allows me
somewhat more flexibility in designing my concept of nephilim.  

In _[Many Waters][MW]_ we see clearly that the unfallen angels have a limited perspective on Devine
Providence and Will, and thus make choices based on limited information.  More, they are aware
that their perspective is limited, and their information incomplete.  They thus struggle with
choices.  Not like humanity does - humanity struggles with _if_ they should do right.  Angels
struggle with the question *what is right*.  The unfallen angel always does what that angel
perceives as right, but per _[Many Waters][MW]_ *may perceive poorly*.  The resulting choices may
thus be suboptimal.

While the sanctified soul is thought to be, through grace, elevated above the angels, I believe
this same limited perception would apply, *particularly* before the final judgement.  I will use
that fact.

## Original Sin

Humanity inherits the effects of Adam's first sin, in that we are born already deprived from 
grace.[^230717-1]  There is remarkably little verifiably known about angels, and the Church
Fathers themselves debate about the proper translation of the the word "nephilim" that I am
misusing in this story.  I am left with far too wide a field in which to speculate.

I am going to speculate that the angelic powers would have their own version of original sin.
That just as humanity was made to be in union with God, so that the lack of grace is a flaw in
man, and a stain on his soul and personality, so too the angel.  The angels were given great 
power, but this power was intended to be used in union with God.  Clearly they did not lose
all access to the power given them with the fall.  However, there must have been some effect.

Whatever this effect is, the nephilim of my story would inherit that as well.  Thus in
a sense they would inherit two "original" sins.  One from their human ancestor, and one from
their angelic ancestor(s).  This dual lack would further incline the nephilim away from God, 
temptation and concupiscense is far greater for the nephilim than for humanity.

## Sacraments

### Baptism and Confirmation

I believe that these sacraments would be, in essence, unaffected by the
magical nature of the nephilim.  The purpose of Baptism is to wash away
the effects of sin, and to trigger a supernatural adoption and thus
introduction to grace.  If humanity can inherit a fallen state from Adam
and Eve in the form of original sin, then the nephilim would inherit this
'fallenness' twice over, because they inherit something of the effects of
the angels' fall from grace as well.  Baptism washes away *all sin*.

The nephilim need this sacrament, and benefit from it, even more than humanity.

Confirmation strengthens the positive effects of Baptism, further initiating
us into the life of grace and into the Church.  I suspect that the Gifts of
the Holy Spirit would have an even more visible and greater effect on the
nephilim than they do on humanity.  When you consider the lives of the saints,
this is a bold statement.

I do not mean that these gifts would enhance their magic.  But consider the
backstory I give for the [giants] or the [goblins].  A nephil infused with
the gift "for grasping revealed truths easily and profoundly"[^230714-2] and
thus "brought to the knowledge of a greater number of truths by drawing
numerous conclusions from revealed principles"[^230714-3] will find the free
will debilitating effects of inherited sin counter balanced with incredible
power.  He or she will be empowered to use the free will remaining to him
or her to avoid sin far more powerfully in part *because* the reduced
freedom will make the remaining choices more black and white to this enhanced
perception.

### Marriage

Because of the implications of [magical contracts], the Church has been forced
to question whether nor not being a nephil is inherently an impediment to a
sacramental marriage.  Most theologians (in this story) believe this to be the
case, but (again in this story) the Church has not ruled infalliby on the matter.

[magical contracts]: <{{< relref "Appendix_F" >}}>

### Holy Orders

Like with marriage, the Church has had to wrestle with whether or not a
(male) nephil can be ordained.  Again, (in this story) most theologians
believe the problems inherent in their nature form an insurmountable
impediment to the valid reception of the sacrament.  In the Western Rite,
the Pope, specifically speaking as Patriarch of the Western Rite, and *not*
as head of the universal Church, has ruled that they are not to be ordained.

### Sacraments of Healing

Like Baptism and Confirmation, I believe that the two sacraments of healing
are both efficacious for (baptised) nephilim.

Specific to this story, Anointing of the Sick should be able to heal some
of the effects of "dark" magic that nephilim believe impossible to heal.  God
is not and will not be limited.  Just as the nephilim's physical form is
more easily permanently affected by sin, it is also more easily permanently
affected by grace.

### The Holy Eucharist

The more you understand this sacrament, the less it should be necessary to
state that this sacrament is not and cannot be affected by the difference
between a nephil and a human.  The key difference is between baptised and
unbaptised.
