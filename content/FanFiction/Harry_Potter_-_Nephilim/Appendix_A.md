#### Things differing for those familiar with _Many Waters_

* L'Engle calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox
  theology and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil
  (I'm using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil -
  nephilim).[^211201-1] 
* L'Engle has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old
  Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am
  positing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament
  times. 

#### Things Specifically Pulled from _Many Waters_

* Being seduced by a fallen angel is not just a matter of falling in love with
  the wrong person, the fallen angel also seduces you into an evil ritual that
  corrupts your soul. I am going to extend this and call such a person a witch.
  See below for deviations from Harry Potter. 
* The fallen angels directly interact with humanity and have visible
  manifestations of the powers they retain from their angelic nature.  I'm
  extending this to say that some of these are inherited.  
* All of the angels and nephil found in _Many Waters_ are, in Harry Potter
  terms, animagi.  More, these animal forms are symbolic in some way of the
  angel or nephil in question.  Again, per above, I am not using L'Engle's
  definition of nephil, but I am keeping this aspect.  All nephil have the
  ability to be an animagi, and this transformation is, when not specifically
  suppressed, natural to them.  

#### Things Specifically Pulled from _Screwtape_

* Lewis describes the effect of sin on the fallen angles in _[The Screwtape
  Letters][TSL2]_.[^210408-1]  At various places I talk about "bizarre" things
  happening to nephil.  This is more or less what I envision.  Essentially these
  represent instances of Divine Justice, sometimes mediated by the actual
  angels.  This is the primary idea pulled from that source.  I am going to be
  inconsistent in my language about this, because it is (and always has been)
  unclear to both the nephilim and the clergy how much is something *the
  nephilim* did wrong (and was thus avoidable), how much is something *God*
  caused to happen to them, and how much is something that an angel, acting
  within the scope and authority granted that angel by God, has caused of its
  own initiative.  To my mind, because I am also pulling from _Many Waters_
  things in this third category are never *wrong* but might not represent the
  *best possible* action in a given situation.


#### Some Notable Differences from the actual Harry Potter universe

* Harry is noticeably out of character in this story.  I will try to make him
  the exception rather than the norm.  However, to the extent that characters
  are formed by their experiences across the actual Harry Potter series, they
  may end up in different places (emotionally/psychologically) between my first
  chapter and last, than they did between Mrs. Rowling's first book and last.
* Witches are those corrupted by union with fallen angels.  They do gain power
  (magic) from this union, but are corrupted by it.  Should they repent and
  receive forgiveness from their sins, they would also lose their access to
  magic.  It is from these people that the persistent rumours about non-magical
  people "stealing magic" come.  It is possible (in this story) for someone to
  *become* magical. 
* Following from the origin of magic I'm using, magic will follow somewhat
  different [rules]({{< relref "/appendix_b" >}}) than the Harry Potter books.
  This includes both the way the characters use magic and magical creatures.
* Those that call themselves witches *are not actually.*  They are nephilim.
  That is, the actual characters you encounter are not what this story's true
  history would term a witch.  
* Modern day welders of magic, heavily influenced by paganism and by those who
  have given into temptation, have obscured the difference between those who
  inherit magic and those who have gained it through sin. They call all female
  welders of magic witches, this is part denial, part self delusion, and part
  ignorance. Exactly how much of which differs from person to person. 
* The Old Testament references to witches refer to those corrupted by union with
  fallen angels, not to the children of such unions (This is almost certainly
  bogus and entirely fictional theology, but it is necessary for world
  building).
* The Statue of Secrecy was imperfectly implemented.  At one point, knowledge of
  the a-fore bullet points was commonly taught to most clergy.  With the
  disruptions to the education of clergy wrought by the enlightenment, and
  worse, by the modern era, now only a few priests and bishops know this
  history.
* Per the above, I am asserting a historical fiction: witch hunting was a
  product of ignorance (sometimes poorly educated priests yes) and even more so
  of Protestantism.  The rejection of those parts of Sacred Tradition not
  contained in the Bible by Protestants caused them to reject the true
  understanding of the interactions between the fallen angels and humanity. 
* Magic users *are not human.*  Just like a hippogriff is a blend of the
  incompatible horse and eagle that is not fully one nor the other, the person
  who can use magic is a nephil, not a human. 
   * As a distortion of God's creation, nephilim do not, cannot fit cleanly into
     either creation or Divine Law. 
     * [Soteriology][WP1], [Missiology][WP2], and [Ecclesiology][WP3] get
       interesting (and fictional) curlicues and footnotes trying to deal with
       the chaotic fallout of the interaction between the angelic and the human
       in a nephil's nature.  This lets me do things to/with the characters that
       would not otherwise be at all moral. 
     * I will somewhat compare the nephil to mules or <{{ wikipedia ligers }}>.
       While in some ways they may appear to have advantages to one or both
       parent species, they are an artificial, unnatural 'creation'. 
   * Just as a hippogriff is impossible by normal genetics, and cannot be
     explained by Mendelian inheritance patterns, children of either two nephil
     or one human and one nephil do not follow purely Mendelian inheritance
     patterns. 
   * Per the above, all nephil are animagi.  However, normally a child, growing
     up around those who either do not have or do not use this power, begins to
     instinctively suppress the ability. This suppression thing is how I am
     merging the Harry Potter concept with the _Many Waters_ concept, and is
     thus found in neither original work.  Some traditions, like that described
     in _Short Stories of Heroism_ are time consuming, difficult, and
     exacting.[^220628-1]  In this work this is not because of the inherent
     difficulty of the actual magic, but rather the drawn out ritual is,
     functionally but unknowingly to the nephil population (who largely have
     not studied any actual psychology), training the nephil to *allow* the
     change, to overcome the enculturated inhibitions against using this power.
     Moreover, Magic is in part about belief, you cannot do something you
     believe you cannot do.  Thus if you believe that the transformation is
     difficult, you can (unconsciously) *make it difficult.*  
   * Uagadou is known for teaching self transfiguration.[^220628-2]  Their
     results differ from the way most nephil communities handle the animagi
     ability.  Rather than working with the student's innate form, the Uagadou
     school teaches students to mutate themselves, and thus to *change* their
     innate form.  They disregard the repercussions this has on the student's
     core personality, and sometimes even on the person's ability to function
     in normal human society.
* I intended this long before I read this in any other work: faith, prayer, the
  Sacraments, and sacramentals will all have actual effects.[^210412-5]

[^211201-1]: There is nothing truly unique in Fan Fiction. 
    * In _[Error of Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518)_
      Materia-Blade has a line referring to magical folk as Nephilim.  I came up
      with this idea well before I found that work.  Just goes to show that there
      is nothing possible that *someone* else hasn't also thought of. in 
    * In _[Losing Control](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9157305)_
      JackPotr has an overlapping explanation of where magical humans came
      from.  I had read this before starting this work, but had totally
      forgotten until after I had fleshed out the primary Appendices and the
      first handful of chapters.
