### Overall Rules

#### power levels

Nephil can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) for access to each class
of [angelic abilities]({{< relref "#abilities-by-type" >}}). This naturally means that for many of the pivotal
characters, I have [[mathematical notes on their power levels|appendix_b]].  For the purposes of this work:

| Power Level | Ability Estimate |
| :---------: | :-------------- |
| 1           | <ul><li>some single weak ability within this category</li> <li>no conscious control</li></ul>
| 2           | <ul><li>either:<ul><li>multiple barely detectable abilities</li> <li>conscious control of a single weak ability</li></ul></li></ul>
| 3           | <ul><li>able to manipulate this category of magic with great difficulty</li></ul>
| 4           | <ul><li>able to achieve minimally acceptable levels of competence in this category of magic</li> <li>if some OWL test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the P range.</li></ul>
| 5           | <ul><li>expected to achieve acceptable levels of proficiency in this category of magic</li> <li>if some OWL test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the A range.</li></ul>
| 6           | <ul><li>expected to be capable of more advanced learning in this category of magic.</li> <li>if some OWL test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the E range.</li> <li>if some NEWT test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the A range.</li></ul>
| 7           | <ul><li>expected to be capable of doing well in an advanced course on this category of magic.</li> <li>if some OWL test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the O range.</li> <li>if some NEWT test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the E range.</li> <li>possibly capable of learning magics in this category beyond NEWT level.</li></ul>
| 8           | <ul><li>expected to be capable of doing well in an advanced course on this category of magic.</li> <li>if some OWL test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the O range.</li> <li>if some NEWT test depended solely on this category of magic, expect to score in the O range.</li> <li>capable of learning magics in this category beyond NEWT level.</li></ul>
| 9           | <ul><li>expected to learn OWL and NEWT level magics with relative ease.</li> <li>expected to learn magics beyond the NEWT level in this category of magic.</li> <li>instinctual (unconscious) use of magic in this category is extremely common.</li></ul>
| 10          | <ul><li>learning this category of magic is more about finding out what is possible and fine-tuning abilities you already have.</li><li>OWL and NEWT practicals will be easy, but theory portions may be difficult for this person, because their magic is in fact instinctual in this area.</ul>

This begs the question "What do you mean by expected?"  Obviously there is no standards body anywhere in the world that is grading students using these categories.  The nephil in this world have not accepted that they are descended from angels, and thus do not think of their abilities in terms of the angelic choirs.  What I mean is that someone who does not meet the stated goal is being lazy, suppressing their abilities, or both.  They are neglecting their own strengths.  

#### abilities by type

I have categorised each classical type of angel as having originally created a
different type of nephil, which in my notes I call "primordial nephil."  My
intention, however, is that these types are not different species, but rather
more like having different traits that can be independently inherited.  Each
angelic order is described below as per the Areopagite model.[^220628-4] I then
follow that description with how their powers/nature have been inherited by
nephil.

Seraphim
:   These angels perceive God most directly, and know him in and as Himself best.
:   In the fusion with the material, the nephil has lost the ability to
    perceive God directly.  However, as man is a limited image of God, the nephil
    has the ability to perceive the heart of the man/nephil.  When used on other
    nephil, this allows access to information about the person's physical
    state, their will, and their memories.  When used on humans, it allows only
    access to information about the person's physical state.  However, an
    astute judge of human nature can combine this with situational awareness,
    historical information about the person, body language, and similar data to
    make highly accurate guesses.

Cherubim
:   These angels perceive God only indirectly, but understand that perception
    best.  Their work is the contemplation of God through His works.
:   The nephil inherits the the ability to perceive/detect what has been done
    with magic, and what is possible with it.  This is a more passive ability
    than is inherited from any other choir, and could be confused with the
    mastery granted by inheriting a power level of 10 from the other choirs.
    The difference is that the Cherub's child really does not even need to be
    taught to the extent they inherit.  You will find no class in Hogwarts
    about detecting "spell residue" or similar ideas found in other fan fiction
    works, because you can either do this without training or you cannot.  
    
From the Thrones
:   The Thrones contemplate Judgement.
:   While the Thrones, like the Seraphim, are primarily contemplative, the
    inheritance from them is, again like that from the Seraphim, much more
    active.  The nephil has the ability to bind the will of other nephilim.
    For the purposes of this story, and *unlike cannon Harry Potter*, this
    ability has marginal *at best* affect on full humans. Things like the
    imperious curse or the confundus charm fit in here.  Thus fan fiction
    concepts like magical contracts are actually possible.
    
Dominions
:   These angels are responsible for ordering the work of all other angels.
    Their name implies actual, real authority. 
:   The relationship between the way Dominions operate and the abilities the
    nephilim gain is somewhat indirect.  God creates by decree - He spoke and
    the world was made.  The nephilim are not capable of true creation, but
    have authority only over the *form*,but not the substance, of the material
    world.  They can thus by their magic transmute the form of one thing to
    another.  This will be temporary unless the change is "locked" in place
    through combining this ability with that inherited from the Powers. Neither
    alone can make a transmutation permanent.  That is, the Powers cannot
    retroactively make a transmutation permanent, it must be done *as the change
    is made, by the same nephil*.

From the Virtues
:   The Virtues are responsible for enforcing the laws of physics.  Traditional
    sources tell us that they generally concern themselves primarily with
    massively macroscopic effects, but I cannot understand them in any other
    way.  My personal theory, which will naturally be used here, is that
    actually *doing* anything with the way physical laws work at a microscopic
    and sub-microscopic level would be either catastrophic, unduly influence
    free will for those affected by it, or both.  
:   The nephil inherits the ability to temporarily augment the nature of the
    natural world. Things like animation charms fit here, but so do things like
    levitation charms. The other thing that fits here is that when
    a nephil who inherits from the Virtues handles certain raw materials
    (potions ingredients), these become "charged" with extra properties.  This
    is a deviation from Mrs. Rowling's explanation for potions.

Powers
:   Powers are the first of the overtly militant angelic orders (looking from
    top down).  They prevent the work of the Virtues from interference.  This,
    to me, implies that God providentially foresaw that giving angels free will
    would entail a universe in which that free will was exercised in wrong
    ways. 
:   The nephil inherits the ability to affect time.  When used directly on the
    natural world, this results in things like time turners on one hand, but
    also stasis charms on the other.  Divination is *not* included in this
    ability, that is something different.  When used on a magical effect, you
    can make it last longer (even permanently) or shorter (a finite incantatem
    charm for example totally cancels it).  

Principalities
:   The principalities are concerned with groups of people - nations, cities,
    clubs, ethnic groups.  They are not concerned with the individual, but with
    the common good.  
:   The nephil inherits the ability to create area effects on populations
    (unplottable, "muggle repelling", so on). This differs from the Thrones in
    that the gifts from the Thrones affect individuals regardless of location.
    The gifts from the Principalities affect whoever, full human or nephil, is
    in the right location to be affected, and no one who is not in relationship
    to that location.  Your ability to see into a place, remember a place, stay
    near a place, so on.

Archangels
:   These angels are tasked with particular goals in particular times and
    places.  Heal this person, protect that person, deliver this message.  They
    accomplish concrete tasks on God's behalf, with whatever force is required
    to do so.
:   The nephil's inheritance is again indirect.  The Archangels exercise
    visible force, the nephil gains the ability to use magic to enforce his
    will.  Again, there is some potential confusion with the prior orders.  The
    Thrones affect the will of the person either directly (other nephil) or
    indirectly (humans).  The target then causes an effect.  The Archangel's
    child causes visible effects, these effects have the affect of forcing
    others to obey.  The Principalities' children also overlap some, but their
    children are not affecting any *particular* person with their effects, nor
    does the use of this magic result in a visible effect.  Recall that the
    nephilim come from fallen angels, so some of these offensive magics are
    corrupted and should not be used.  This is not to say that all harm is
    always bad, but some magic requires a mindset that is inherently twisted. 

Angels
:   Also called Guardian Angels, these angels are tasked with the welfare of
    specific individuals in a general sense.  They differ from the Archangel who
    has a particular goal to achieve in time and space in that the Guardian
    Angel is concerned with the *moral* state of its assigned person.  The
    Guardian Angel is concerned with salvation.
:   The inheritance from the nephil is the ability to resist magical force, of
    any kind, from any other class of magic.  Shield spells, spells to undue
    effects (which differs from stopping the duration very slightly but
    significantly).   This is not, however, necessarily safe magic.  These can
    also be corrupted to the point of being dangerous to the user.  A defensive
    measure might still warp the mind/soul of the user; it might effectively be
    resisting too much, or the wrong way.  For example in the physical world I
    can drown out a voice by being louder, by covering my ears, or by
    puncturing my ear drums.   While the last is extreme, and only a crazy
    person would do it, well, remember that nephil do not always understand how
    their magic affects them.

### mapping to Harry Potter

Harry Potter cannon breaks magic down into:

charms
:   generally a mix of inheritance from Virtues and Powers for the lower years,
    however
    - things like "cheering charms" are _actually_ a form of transmutation
      manipulating the form of brain chemicals, and thus, temporarily, their
      effect.
    - memory charms like obliviation are a mix of transmutation on brain
      chemicals with the Seraphic ability to perceive (and thus target the
      transmutation really precisely). Because they are chemical in nature, they
      can work on full humans.  However, they can be more precisely targeted and
      more finely crafted/tuned when used against a nephil.  Thus you can make a
      human forget, say, the last hour, or the last day; you can make a nephil
      forget that a single person was present while otherwise remembering the
      event.
    - Imperious curse acts differently on humans and nephil. Using the
      imperious curse on a human will require "operating" that human like you
      would a puppet or a remote control robot, while using it on a nephil acts
      more like what you see in the Harry Potter books, where you can give a
      command and the victim's own mind will assist in finding ways to carry out
      the order.
    - Confundus type charms only work well on nephil, because they extend memory
      charms by depending on abilities inherited from Thrones. When used on a
      human, this charm interferes with the ability to form a long term memory,
      and the ability to retrieve long term memories, both for the duration of
      the charm, and it causes the various chemicals in the brain to surge.  So
      humans will tend to end up all sorts of confused, but without the fine
      grained control over what they are confused about, or what they think is
      actually happening that you can achieve with a nephil.  Note that not all
      nephil are *aware* of the difference in affect here.

transfiguration
:   comes primarily from the Dominions, but is highly temporary unless you use
    abilities from the Virtues to augment reality to make a permanent change
    possible *as you make the change*.

animagus
:   In the Harry Potter books, this is a form of transfiguration enabled by the
    use of a ritual that combines a repeated spell with a potion.  The article
    on Uagadou[^220628-5] implies, but does not outright state, that in the
    cannonical books there are ways to influence what animal you become.
    Synchronised transformation does not make a ton of sense unless they did so
    *to the same target animal*, but the magical world *doesn't* always make
    sense.  Either way, in this story there are different ways to "become" an
    animagus.  In fact, it would be more accurate to say "unlock" the ability,
    as this is not actually an ability inherited via one of the powers
    enumerated above, but a separate inheritance common no matter what
    rank/choir of angel(s) one decends from.   Students of the Uagadou school
    use powers meld abilities from the Thrones, the Powers, and the Dominions
    to transmute their own nature to the desired animal (or animals), so that
    when they exercise the inherit animagus ability, they become an "unnatural"
    animal.  Few ever realize how invasive this transmutation is to their sense
    of self.  Other cultures have other ways of unlocking this ability, some of
    which are safer than others.

conjuring
:   requires inheritance from the Powers, as you are in essence manipulating
    quantum probabilities.  No nephil *actually* understands how conjuring
    *actually* works.  You have manipulated time in a highly localized (nearly
    negligible) space until it becomes probable that quanta will appear in the
    desired configuration, and more, that this has *actually happened* (and not
    some other quantum affect).  Unlike the standard Harry Potter, conjuration
    will tend to be permanent.

Vanishing
:   though considered transfiguration, this is actually a really wierd mix of
    abilities from Virtues and Powers.  Like conjuring, no nephil *correctly*
    understands it.  You are essentially making the thing vanished air
    soluable, then for the space that thing occupies, manipulating time such
    that it appears to have instantly disolved.  Because it is explained so
    poorly, students new to the practice will often actually attempt to modify
    the physical properties of the thing being vanished instead of its chemical
    properties, resulting in transparent versions instead of something that
    has, to paraphrase McGonagall, gone into everything.

Potions
:   These are complicated.  The magic comes in part from the brewer (primarily
    from the Virtues), and in part from the ingredients (different ingredients
    will react to your magical influence in different ways).  No two nephil will
    affect ingredients precisely the same way; similarly no two instances of the
    same ingredient are actually precisely the same.  A strong ability inherited
    from the Cherubim will make you more able to discern the effects of the
    ingredients, including between instances of supposedly identical
    ingredients. Thus the best potioneers strongly inherit from both the
    Cherubim and Virtues. Some potions additionally require chemical reactions
    not possible in nature, this requires the potioneer to have abilities in the
    Power to make a probablistic reaction happen in the desired time frame.
    Alternately, the potioneeer can transmute the form of one ingredient to
    make it chemically react the desired way.  Lastly, if a potion is to be
    stored, rather than used immediately, the effects must be locked in place
    *at the time of creation*, again an ability coming from the Powers.

    Potions is a wandless art, though some traditions *do* use incantations as
    part of the process the potioneer trigger their magic. Hogwarts teaches
    potions in its hardest form: both wandless and silent, requiring near
    instinctual use of effectively three to four forms of magic simultaneously.
    The nephil must use abilities inherited from the Virtues to augment the
    ingredients with additional properties, locking the augmentation in place
    using the time magic from the Powers(endless duration).  As this highly
    personal process will result in something slightly different from nephil to
    nephil, he/she must use abilities from the Cherubim to pick precisely the
    ingredients affected by his/her magic to precisely the right degree and in
    precisely the right way.  Should the ingredients not want to mix, the
    nephil then uses abilities inherited from either the Dominions or the
    Virtues, either transmuting the form of the ingredient into something that
    can mix, or to manipulate the laws of chemistry to make the reaction
    possible. The different ways and patterns of stirring are essentially
    mental triggers to help the nephil activate their magic.  This means that a
    potion recipe is more of a suggestion than a true recipe, the best will
    always come from deviating from the recipe by *just the right amount* to
    account for your personal magic and the specific ingredients you happen to
    be using in this particular instance.

Runes
:   These are also complicated.  Runes are _created_ from powers inherited from
    the Virtues, you augment reality to give your writing not just meaning, but
    power.  They are, however, *powered* by the inheritance related to the
    effect of the runes in question.  Thus two people equally skilled at
    creating runes might not be equally skilled at powering those runes, or vice
    versa. This is also a deviation from the cannon Harry Potter universe.
    Runes can also be created to *absorb* power from the surrounding area to
    power connected sequences of runes, using abilities inherited from the
    Principalities.  This in practice reduces the effect of any attempt to use
    other powers in any way not connected to that rune sequence.  For a school
    like Hogwarts, it would be safer to practice your magic because the effect
    of each spell would be lessened.  The Hospital Wing would need to be
    shielded from most of the runes protecting the rest of the castle to ensure
    that you could still be cured using magic at full efficacy.  Overall, this
    effect would bluster Hogwart's reputation for being one of the safest places
    in Britain.

Divination
:   This magic has two categories.
    - prophesy is a morally suspect magic.  I am going to go with Biblical
      theology here; in divination the nephil knowingly or unknowingly
      communicates with fallen angels.  If they ever tell anything truthful, it
      is only because they judge it useful to lead us further into sin. Thus
      most prophesies are misleading, false, or both.  This fits well with what
      Mrs. Rowling writes in her original FAQ when she compared her series'
      prophecy to the one from _Macbeth_.[^20210902-5]
    - Users particularly skilled in the abilities from the Seraphim may be able
      to use these abilities to make incredibly accurate predictions about
      people without crossing any lines.  Knowing that someone is clumsy from
      their memories, knowing that someone is afraid from their emotions, the
      user can predict some short term events and reactions in ways that might
      seem like divination.  Practices like palm reading, tea leaves, and
      crystal gazing grew from this magical insight into people
    - There is some crossover between the two, generally to the detriment of
      both the user and any understanding of the truth.

    Users of the first form make future generations more susceptible to magics
    inherited from the Seraphim and Thrones (for four generations per my rules
    on nephil [inheritance]({{< relref "Appendix_C" >}})).  So while in general someone strong in the Thrones
    could normally resist the imperious curse, if they come from a family
    steeped in the use of divination, then he/she personally will be
    abnormally susceptible to this magic.

Arithmancy
:   This has a Wikipedia definition as being a speciality of divination.  For my
    purposes this is _almost_ true.  For my purposes Arithmancy attempts to
    predict the effect of a use of magic.  It attempts to make magic scientific.
    However, it is complicated by the fact that its practitioners themselves do
    not actually understand the scientific method, nor agree on which
    mathematical system(s) they are using to do this in.  The field is dominated
    by people with only the vaguest idea of what the mundane world has done with
    either numbers or science in the past 200 years.

Legilimency
:   This requires both an inheritance from the Seraphim and the Thrones, for
    this work it comes in 3 phases.
    - Passively, it is solely from the Seraphim, and is morally neutral. This
      will tell you a target's emotional state (anything related to brain
      chemistry), whether or not the person is telling the truth (again based on
      brain chemistry and things like pulse rates, but done automatically for
      you by the magic), energy level/alertness, and other purely physical
      things but _not_ about the person's actual thoughts or memories. A really
      skilled user may be able to infer thoughts from a however with a fair
      degree of accuracy.
    - Unidirectionally Outbound, it adds in abilities from the Thrones, forcing
      the recipient to hear your thoughts. This is a bit of a grey area morally.
    - Actively, you force the victim to reveal their memories, implant memories,
      or manipulate emotional states.  For some unknown reason, unless the
      target has at least some magic, you will be unable to do more than
      manipulate emotional states.  This manipulation goes beyond the simple
      transmutation of brain chemicals, it actually causes the brain to release
      the appropriate chemicals as if naturally in that emotional state. All
      active legilimency is morally repugnant, and comes at a magical cost.
      Excessive use of this form of legilimency will have bizarre effects.  The
      effects may be physical, spiritual, mental, or any combination thereof.
      Per the above, what constitutes "excessive" has not been quantified.  To
      the extent that the use is not just excessive but also malicious and/or
      selfish in nature, the effects will not only be bizarre but hereditary,
      *and* will be coupled with reduced will-power in subsequent generations
      as is described in the section of magical inheritance for magics
      requiring emotional content.

Occlumency
:   The magical suppression of emotion and with that access to thoughts comes at
    a similar moral and magical cost to active legilimency. At first glance,
    one would think this comes from the Guardian angels.  It does not.  It is
    the use of force directed against oneself, regardless of if there is an
    attack to negate or not.  This will require inheritance from the Cherubim
    (for targeting), the Dominions (for transmuting brain chemicals), and the
    Seraphim (dealing with the non-material parts of men/nephil).  Lacking
    *any* of these will basically mean you are not going to succeed at
    Occlumency.  This story will offer magical defences to legilimency besides
    that of occlumency.
