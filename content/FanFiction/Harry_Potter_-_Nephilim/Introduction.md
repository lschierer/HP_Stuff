On reading _[Many Waters][MW]_ by Madeleine L'Engle, a number of ideas came
together and I started thinking about the Harry Potter universe in a different
way.  Mrs. L'Engle's theology in that book is *really really* sketchy, but like
many distortions of true Catholic thought, makes for interesting fiction.  This
is not really a cross-over, you will not see the characters from any of the
non-Rowling works I am taking ideas from here.

Rather, as I said, that book caused a me to think about the Harry Potter
universe differently, but it was not until I was reading CmptrWz' _[For Want of
an Outfit][FWoaO1]_ Chapters 30 through 35 that what I am trying for here
*really* came clear.  Left unadulterated, Mrs. Rowling's Harry Potter universe
has too few consequences.  I harp on that theme in my [[Harrypedia]].  This
fanfiction is a harsher universe.  Magic, even if not "dark" and *intentionally*
harmful, cannot always be undone or fixed.  There can be not only life-long
repercussions, but *generational* repercussions from the spells and potions that
are so often carelessly used.  

I am taking some things from _[Many Waters][MW2]_, some from C. S. Lewis' _[The
Screwtape Letters][TSL]_, some from actual Catholic theology, some from various
myths and legends, and some from Tolkien's Middle Earth universe.  I am grafting
these ideas into the Harry Potter universe, replacing some of its actual world
building with these grafted bits, extending it in other places.  

A lot of authors will try to do almost all their world building within the
narrative.  I realise this is technically better, but it is also harder to do.
Since I am pulling from several disparate, previously existing, universes that
the reader may well already be familiar with, and because I am *not* an awesome
writer actually capable of pulling off the vision in my head, I am going to set
the stage partially here in the introduction, and provide some of the world
building in the form of appendices that authors generally do not publish.  These
world building notes are useful to understand the story, but are hopefully not
truly necessary.  That being said, I am not going to go out of my way to explain
in depth the way some authors do since an interested reader *can* find it in
this extra information.

### Points of Divergence 

#### Things differing for those familiar with _Many Waters_

* L'Engle calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox
  theology and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil
  (I'm using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil -
  nephilim).[^211201-1] 
* L'Engle has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old
  Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am
  positing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament
  times. 
* Lewis describes the effect of sin on the fallen angles in _[The Screwtape
  Letters][TSL2]_.[^210408-1]  At various places I talk about "bizarre" things
  happening to nephil.  This is more or less what I envision.  Essentially these
  represent instances of Divine Justice, sometimes mediated by the actual
  angels.  This is the primary idea pulled from that source.  I am going to be
  inconsistent in my language about this, because it is unclear to the nephilim
  how much is something *they* did wrong (and was thus avoidable), how much is
  something *God* caused to happen to them, and how much is something that an
  angel, acting within the scope and authority granted that angel by God, has
  caused of its own initiative.  

#### Things Specifically Pulled from _Many Waters_

* Being seduced by a fallen angel is not just a matter of falling in love with
  the wrong person, the fallen angel also seduces you into an evil ritual that
  corrupts your soul. I am going to extend this and call such a person a witch.
  See below for deviations from Harry Potter. 
* The fallen angels directly interact with humanity and have visible
  manifestations of the powers they retain from their angelic nature.  I'm
  extending this to say that some of these are inherited. 

#### Some Notable Differences from the actual Harry Potter universe

* Harry is noticeably out of character in this story.  I will try to make him
  the exception rather than the norm.
* Witches are those corrupted by union with fallen angels.  They do gain power
  (magic) from this union, but are corrupted by it.  Should they repent and
  receive forgiveness from their sins, they would also lose their access to
  magic.  It is from these people that the persistent rumours about non-magical
  people "stealing magic" come.  It is possible (in this story) for someone to
  *become* magical. 
* Following from the origin of magic I'm using, magic will follow somewhat
  different [rules]({{ relref . "/appendix_a" }}) than the Harry Potter books.
  This includes both the way the characters use magic and magical creatures.
* Those that call themselves witches *are not actually.*  They are nephilim.
  That is, the actual characters you encounter are not what this story's true
  history would term a witch.  
* Modern day welders of magic, heavily influenced by paganism and by those who
  have given into temptation, have obscured the difference between those who
  inherit magic and those who have gained it through sin. They call all female
  welders of magic witches, this is part denial, part self delusion, and part
  ignorance. Exactly how much of which differs from person to person. 
* The Old Testament references to witches refer to those corrupted by union with
  fallen angels, not to the children of such unions (This is almost certainly
  bogus and entirely fictional theology, but it is necessary for world
  building).
* The Statue of Secrecy was imperfectly implemented.  At one point, knowledge of
  the a-fore bullet points was commonly taught to most clergy.  With the
  disruptions to the education of clergy wrought by the enlightenment, and
  worse, by the modern era, now only a few priests and bishops know this
  history.
* Per the above, I am asserting a historical fiction: witch hunting was a
  product of ignorance (sometimes poorly educated priests yes) and even more so
  of Protestantism.  The rejection of those parts of Sacred Tradition not
  contained in the Bible by Protestants caused them to reject the true
  understanding of the interactions between the fallen angels and humanity. 
* Magic users *are not human.*  Just like a hippogriff is a blend of the
  incompatible horse and eagle that is not fully one nor the other, the person
  who can use magic is a nephil, not a human. 
   * As a distortion of God's creation, nephilim do not, cannot fit cleanly into
     either creation or Divine Law. [Soteriology][WP1], [Missiology][WP2], and
     [Ecclesiology][WP3] get interesting (and fictional) curlicues and footnotes
     trying to deal with the chaotic fallout of the interaction between the
     angelic and the human in a nephil's nature.  This lets me do things to/with
     the characters that would not otherwise be at all moral. 
   * Just as a hippogriff is impossible by normal genetics, and cannot be
     explained by Mendelian inheritance patterns, children of either two nephil
     or one human and one nephil do not follow purely Mendelian inheritance
     patterns. 
* I intended this long before I read this in any other work: faith, prayer, the
  Sacraments, and sacramentals will all have actual effects.[^210412-5]

    Materia-Blade has a line referring to magical folk as Nephilim.  I came up
    with this idea well before I found that work.  Just goes to show that there
    is nothing possible that *someone* else hasn't also thought of.
