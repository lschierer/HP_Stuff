On reading _[Many Waters][MW]_ by Madeleine L'Engle, a number of ideas came
together and I started thinking about the Harry Potter universe in a different
way.  Mrs. L'Engle's theology in that book is *really really* sketchy, but like
many distortions of true Catholic thought, makes for interesting fiction.  This
is not really a cross-over, you will not see the characters from any of the
non-Rowling works I am taking ideas from here.  A huge multi-way crossover is,
however, the most concise way to describe what this *is*.  I am taking some
things from _[Many Waters][MW2]_, some from C. S. Lewis' _[The Screwtape
Letters][TSL]_, some from actual Catholic theology, some from various myths and
legends, and some from Tolkien's Middle Earth universe.  I am grafting these
ideas into the Harry Potter universe, replacing some of its actual world
building with these grafted bits, extending it in other places.  

A lot of authors will try to do almost all their world building within the
narrative.  I realise this is technically better, but it is also harder to do.
Since I am pulling from several disparate, previously existing, universes that
the reader may well already be familiar with, and because I am *not* an awesome
writer actually capable of pulling off the vision in my head, I am going to set
the stage partially here in the introduction, and provide some of the world
building in the form of appendices that authors generally do not publish.  These
world building notes are useful to understand the story, but are hopefully not
truly necessary.  That being said, I am not going to go out of my way to explain
in depth the way some authors do since an interested reader *can* find it in
this extra information. 

### Points of Divergence 

* L'Engle calls the fallen angels the nephilim.  I'm using more orthodox
  theology and calling the progeny of the union of an angel and a human a nephil
  (I'm using seraph - seraphim, cherub - cherubim, nephil -
  nephilim).[^211201-1] 
* L'Engle has all such end with the great flood.  Later passages in the Old
  Testament suggest that nephilim continue to exist after the flood.  I am
  ositing that fallen angels continued to seduce women during the Old Testament
  times. 
* Lewis describes the effect of sin on the fallen angles in _[The Screwtape
  Letters][TSL2]_
