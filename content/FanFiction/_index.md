# Harry Potter Fan Fiction 

The stories here are works where I am either the primary author, or where I
have picked up an abandoned fan fiction story with the intent to extend and
(perhaps someday) finish it.   Honestly, the more I work on these stories, the
more I realize that I lack the attention span and persistence to follow through
on these to completion, but it occassionally amuses me to work on one or more
of them.
