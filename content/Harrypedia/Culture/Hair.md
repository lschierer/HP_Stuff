A number of fan fiction authors have speculated that there may be cultural
implications to the fact that [Lucius Malfoy][LM1] wears his hair
long[^220719-1], while [Draco Malfoy][DLM1] does not[^220719-2].  As best I can
tell from a cursory search, there is no non-magical historical basis for an
association between hair length and societal status in Europe.[^220719-3]  Thus
if true, this would be something unique to the magical world, and more over, a
uniqueness not substantiated by the cannonical works.
