While the books suggest that [Molly][MP1] has her children do their chores
largely without magic, I simply cannot see wealthy teen-aged girls going to
social events without magical assistance, be it charms for their hair, magical
replacements for make-up (either charms, potions, or both), charms for clothing
(both for fit and to make the appearance more â€¦ magical), so on.  Some of this
may be built into the fabric when it is purchased, but I am reminded of the
descriptions of elfin women in _The Elvenbane_[^210329-20].  In that series,
the women use their appearance and clothing to display their magical prowess,
with the goal of making themselves more attractive as brides.  Sure no one talks
much of that in Harry Potter, but I think it is only because it *is* largely a
child's series, with little attention paid to marriage or the finding of a
spouse. The hints of this are there.  [Lily Evens][LJE1]' magical prowess is referenced
over and over again, even by Hagrid[^210329-21] [Neville][NL1] comes from a good
family, but is belittled for a supposed lack of power.[^210329-22] [Ginny][GMW1]'s
power is also remarked upon.[^210329-23]

That aside, if [Molly][MP1] is going to teach [Ginny][GMW1] to cook, is she
really going to teach her to do so entirely without magic?  Sure, [Ginny][GMW1]
can peel potatoes, or chop vegetables, but we see [Molly][MP1] making some sort
of cream sauce with her wand, as well as lighting the stove.[^210329-24] Even
if you suppose both silent casting like we see in book six, and a form of
casting that does not depend on precise wand movements, to both turn on a gas
stove and light it with a single poke? It seems more that [Molly][MP1] has a
stove designed for wand-based operation.  If that is true, [Ginny][GMW1] would
have to use her wand, or at least *a* wand, to learn to cook on it.  While some
families might have house elves, I think that the world described is
sufficiently traditional that most mothers would be teaching daughters to cook,
and thus an exception must exist.
