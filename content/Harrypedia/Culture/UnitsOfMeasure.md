In general I try to respect that this is British Literature, and thus should
follow British patterns of speech, spelling, and usage.  Interestingly when it
comes to units of measure, the "right" answer is not nearly so clear cut. 

Perhaps most definitively, inches and feet are used universally in the
wizarding world in the original Harry Potter books.[^230302-1]  Perhaps more
telling, she uses the distance of 200 miles between Little Hangleton and Privet
Drive,[^230302-2] despite the fact that this is purely a narrative element.
This second example leaves the situation rather more confused.  

Is the avoidance of metric a stylistic thing, done to emphasise the backwards
nature of wizarding world?  If so, why persist it into the narrator's voice?
Did the editor suggest that consistency would be better?  Does Rowling dislike
the metric system?  A quick search suggests that there is some push back
against it, that some people would prefer the imperial system as more
indicative of a distinctly British identity.[^230302-3]

Either way, my use of old style imperial units is deliberate, and it is
*deviations* from this that should be called out for correction, not adherence
to it.

My personal opinion is that it *is* quite likely that the magical world has
either failed to notice the adoption of the metric system, or deliberately
refused to consider adopting it.  On the British side, adoption is a fairly
recent thing, having begun in 1965,[^230302-4] despite the fact that the metric
system has existed since the 1790s.[^230302-5]  At the international level,
this 1790s date is after the Statute of Secrecy, so the push back against all
things non-magical would have been in full swing.  As the anti-muggle movement
gained traction, the wiliness to adopt a system of measure from the
non-magical world would correspondingly have decreased.
