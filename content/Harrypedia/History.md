| | | |           | Romans pulled out of Britain.[^200623-1]  While Hadrian's wall isn't            |
| | | |           | technically the furthest north they ever went, it seems to be the furthest      |
| | | |           | consistently controlled, and probably represents the northern bounds of         |
| | | |           | Christianity. Note, that bit about Christianity is pure speculation on my part. |
| | | |           | Interestingly, the oldest known "split-nib metal dip pen" dates from around     |
| | | |           | then.[^200816-1]                                                                |

+-+-+------ 800 --+---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| | | |           | The Norse raiders imposed paganism in the areas they controlled, starting |
| | | |           | sometime around 800 through apparently the 10th century.[^200623-5]       |
| | | |           .---------------------------------------------------------------------------.                 
| | | |
| +--------- 900 -+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| | | |           | "The long reign (900–942/3) of Donald's successor Causantín (Constantine II)          |
| | | |           | is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba/Scotland.[^210531-1] |
| | | |           .---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

| | | +---- 992 --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| | | |           | Hogwarts was founded "over a thousand years" before HP2.[^20200622-1] Given   |
| | | |           | the above, we can safely say that by pretty much any date in the 800s or 900s |
| | | |           | Christianity was around. However, it seems safe to say that the Hogwarts      |
| | | |           | founders would also have been recruiting students from pagan backgrounds as   |
| | | |           | well. While the Christian students might have been very anti-magic, the pagan |
| | | |           | ones would more likely have seen magic as part of their religion. Be they     |
| | | |           | druids,[^2021063-2] or Norse, the pagan priest classes no doubt               |
| | | |           | included as much magic as Mrs. Rowling inserts into the Egyptian              |
| | | |           | priest class. While the Cannon text only hints at this, there is              |
| | | |           | really no other good way to explain what Bill is doing in Egypt. There        |
| | | |           | was no Statute of Secrecy after all.                                          |
