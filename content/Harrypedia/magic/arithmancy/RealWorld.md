Christianity has consistently condemned numerology,[^220728-1] a broad term
that includes arithmancy,[^220728-3] since the earliest times. This false
belief comes from the reality that God *has* used numbers to convey real
meaning.[^220728-2]  The difference is that this meaning is in no way "magical"
or intended to tell us about future events, it rather tells us about the nature
of reality _as it currently exists_.

Mrs. Rowling, in writing her series, has clearly drawn ideas from the Christian
(and Jewish) understanding of significant numbers.  Thus understanding the
significance of numbers like [three][] or [seven][] can help understand the
books better.

Thus I expect that in Rowling's universe, the following numbers would be "magically powerful":

* [three][] - a lesser (than seven) completeness. 
* [seven][] - both physical and spiritual perfection
* [nine][] - complete finality
* [ten][] - law, responsibility and complete order
* [twelve][] - divine power and authority
* [seventeen][] - complete victory over an enemy
* [nineteen][] - perfect order/perfect judgement
* [twenty][] - perfect waiting period
* [thirty-three][] - promises kept
