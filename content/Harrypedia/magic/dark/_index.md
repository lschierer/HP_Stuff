### Definition

What makes magic "dark"?  Is "dark" the same as "evil"?  Who decides what
spells, potions, creatures, and other magic is and is not "dark?"  These are
all widely debated questions with many different answers. 

Things so classified are harmful to the caster, the victim, or both in some
way.  If there is a victim, the results are harder or even impossible to
reverse.  In some places there is an implication that it is also harder to even
block. I need citations for this.

Also note that there seems to be more "dark" magic than "light" magic, see my mini-rant on the [balance of power][].

### Analysis

I think that "dark" *should* be synonymous with "evil" but in practice probably
simply means culturally frowned upon and/or legislatively proscribed and/or
controlled.  Parseltounge is "considered" the mark of a "dark
wizard,[^221019-1] simply because of two known speakers being themselves "dark
wizards," and despite the admittedly inconclusive evidence that it is normally
an inherited trait.

You can, if you know your anatomy, kill someone with a sufficiently well placed
cutting spell, regardless of whether or not it is technically a curse.  You can
similarly kill with a tripping jinx, though that one requires that it be timed
such that the person trip such that the fall is fatal.  Levitation, taught in
charms, can be fatal, if the person is released from high enough, or if
something heavy enough is first levitated then released.  Not to mention that
if you can vanish a mammal, you can vanish a human.[^210914-1]  A sufficiently
creative mind can, no doubt, find dozens of other spells from each of charms
and transfiguration that can be used to kill someone.
