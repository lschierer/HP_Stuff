Unlike the Longbottom family, we have at least one cannon reference for the
blacks as a "noble" family.  We do not know if that means they were in fact
part of the peerage or not though.  A significant part of a ton of fanfiction
out there assumes there is a "family vault" that is controlled by a "Lord
Black." It also seems to be a reasonable supposition based on what the books do
state.  Many such fanfiction works further speculate that the [[Malfoy]] family
expects to inherit that control and that title.  If you take Mrs. Rowling's
Black family tree[^210122-26] as part of cannon, such speculation is
baseless.  You have to be careful because she does not clearly distinguish
the male and female children, and because she does not put the children in
birth order on any given line, but if you work your way through it, once
Phineas Nigellus inherited, then the his son Sirius II was heir.
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion, [[Harry]]'s Godfather, descends from that line.
Assume that a godson cannot inherit - reasonable.  Next in line would be
Arcturus I, who had no male children, but decedents of Harfang Longbottom are
unlisted, that might include Neville.  Secondly, since we know that
[[Sirius|adults/Sirius]] Orion was not properly disinherited because he *does*
inherit Grimmauld Place, it is reasonable to suspect that Cedrella Black might
not have been either, despite her marriage to Septimus Weasley.  If so, then the
[[Weasleys|Weasley]] would be in line after the Longbottoms (assuming it is a
different and now extinct branch of the Longbottom family that descends from
Harfang).  We *know* that [[Arthur|adults/Arthur]] [[Weasley]], minimally, lives
to inherit, so there would be no need to go to the third son of Phineus Nigellus -
Cygnus I, from whom Draco is descended.  Remember, even if girls cannot
inherit, their sons can.   If the Black family is following an absolute male
only primogeniture, then Draco would still be unable to inherit as he is in line
via his mother, who would be disqualified by gender.  The dates for this line of
speculation are in the [[History]] timeline.

On a side note, while it flies in the face of some of what I've written above,
Tigerman has an interesting theory in his work [RuneMaster][RMff1].  He suggests
that it is very odd that the portrait of Walburga Black should be so hard to
curtain and cover the way it is, and that more magic must be at work than just
the sticking charm.[^210527-1] While his sense of story timeline is bizarre, I
do like this theory.  [CmptrWz][CW1], in _[For Want of an Outfit][FWO1]_ used a
different but equally magical mechanism to the same end in [Chapter
28][FWOC28-1].[^220627-1]
