It is quite easy to portray [Dumbledore][AD1] as a master
manipulator.[^211203-1]  Indeed, for a fan fiction author, the problem with
this route is not that [Dumbledore][AD1] ends up feeling Out of Character, but
rather that there seems to be a dissociative element to the story if you allow
anything to go *better* than it did in the cannon story line.  How could
[Harry][HJP1] overcome [Dumbledore][AD1] with his decades of experience at
subtle manipulations? Ian Hycrest, writing as Kingsley, describes this sort of
[Dumbledore][AD1] thus:

> It's difficult to try to put into words just how much we all trusted and
> relied on Albus Dumbledore. He was our leader, our counselor, our guide. For
> decades, he had shaped magical society, to the point that to many people, the
> idea of defying him was unimaginable. And yet, he was careful to never be too
> overt, at least not until the end. All it required was a word here, a
> suggestion thereâ€¦ and like the master manipulator that he was, Dumbledore
> ensured that no one truly knew how much he did behind the scenes.

> His was a soft power, subtly swaying those who held actual authority to follow

> that he could do no wrong, he was able to wield an astounding amount of
> influence, ensuring that things went as he desired. His suggestions were

> suspicious. We should have questioned why someone who had such power didn't
> use it to solve the corruption he claimed to oppose. We should have asked why
> he felt the need to meddle in matters that were, quite frankly, none of his
> business. But at the time, that was just the way that things were.

> Perhaps the most disturbing thing is how people responded when his

> produced an outcome that no sane person could possibly accept, Dumbledore

> to do his best against forces beyond his control. And like fools, we all
> believed him.  How could we have been so blind?[^20210629-1]

One might use the fact that he was evicted as Headmaster in Book 2, or from his
various positions in Book 5 as counter examples to this portrayal.  I disagree.
I am not *wholly* convinced of this view of [Dumbledore][AD1] but I believe it is
*plausible*, and I think the proof of its plausibility is really the
conversation at "Kings Cross" at the end of Book 7.  If [Dumbledore][AD1] really
did chart out [Harry][HJP1]'s course, plan the entire war out to include events
after his own death, as is implied, then he is fully capable of including in his
plan temporary defeats on his own part.  The man who uses his own death that way
would certainly also use his own removal from the ICW, and/or the Wizengamot.  

Allowing himself to appear more fallible, more the victim, would endear him to
[Harry][HJP1].  Being recalled to the position after being vindicated would
make the next removal harder (thus I think he *was* in fact able to resist
Fudge and Umbridge in Book 5 for most of the year).  

Why would [Dumbledore][AD1] do this?  As I said on the main page, I do not
think the man evil, just *wrong.*  As indications are that his mother is a
first generation magical, it is unlikely that he is a true blood supremacist, but
in his father's actions I *do* think we have the necessary clue.  I do not
think that his conversations with [Grindelwald][GG] are the first time that
[Dumbledore][AD1] has informally been introduced to thinking that has poor
philosophical roots.  [Percival Dumbledore][PD]'s actions speak loudly of
"might makes right."  He has the power to punish, so he will do so, and stand
proudly in defiance daring the court to judge his actions.  We know this is at
least partly to protect his daughter from a life in a hospital room, but *he
ought not have attacked at all.*  What moral formation did [Albus][AD1] receive
from such a man?

One possibility, which I am not the first to come up with, though I do not
recall where I first read it, is that [Dumbledore][AD1] is not a traditional
purist, but *has* come to value magical lives over non-magical lives.  Couple
this with the fact that he himself feels incredible amounts of guilt, and thus
a powerful need to believe in the possibility of redemption.  Lastly, add in
that he taught most of those involved in the series when they themselves came
through [Hogwarts][] as students.  Such a man might well view these adults, so
much younger than himself, not as fully formed personalities committed to a
path, but as the children they once were, with the opportunities for change
(redemption) he (internally) begs for himself.  If he can redeem them, maybe he
is not himself damned?   The cost to the non-magical population is
insignificant if he can ensure the continuation of a stronger, larger, magical
society.  Such a man may (reluctantly) chose to sacrifice one family of three
([James][JP1], [Lily][LE1] and [Harry][HJP1]) to achieve such an end.
