Lots of fanfiction puts the Longbottom family into the nobility.  I see no
indication of Augusta Longbottom being called "Lady Longbottom" outside of
fanfiction.  We have few descriptions of her, but her fox fur is described as
"moth eaten," which means that if they are part of the nobility, they are
impoverished.
