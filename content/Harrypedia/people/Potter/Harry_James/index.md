### Personality

#### Effects of abuse

See the [[Dursleys]] for some discussion on just how much and in what ways Harry
is abused.  That he is abused to at least some extent is pretty much undeniable.
The only real question is how does he survive it?  How much of his personality
is in fact reflective of, to be brutally honest, damage, how much is innate, how
much is resilience, how much is residual from the first year when he was loved?
Some of it, how much is impossible to estimate, will be hard to explain with
those answers. Some of his personality will need some sort of hand-wavy answer
of "the story requires it for his character to work" (or in other words, this
is a made up character who is simply not realistic).  Any attempt to make it
less impossible essentially requires something along the lines of his mother's
sacrifice not just magically protected him from Tom, but also magically
protected him from the worst of the effects of his upbringing.

explores as a one-shot from when Harry and [[Ginny]] are dating the idea that
perhaps Harry is simply really really good at hiding his reactions.[^200527-1]

#### Slytherin?

The sorting is increasingly a sore point for me.  A huge body of fan fiction
authors want to put Harry in Slytherin.  I know why - they are listening to the
Sorting Hat:

> “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
> courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes
> and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where
> shall I put you?”
>
> Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, *Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.*
>
> “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great,
> you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way
> to greatness, no doubt about that no? Well, if you’re sure better be
> GRYFFINDOR!”[^200602-1]

However, are cunning or ambition really defining traits for Harry?  He might
have liked his scar in the first chapters, but do not let the movies fool you,
that does not last long.  Even in that first Leaky Cauldron scene the books
describe a very different Harry, one who is overwhelmed, not pleased by his
fame.  Once at Hogwarts, Harry finds the attention annoying pretty much right
from the start, and will spend the next 7 years *hating* his fame.  This dislike
of attention will grow so strong that Harry will have trouble accepting praise
not only for being the Boy Who Lived (understandable, he does not remember doing
anything to earn that) but even for his skills on a broom, the fight with the
basilisk, and the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  He keeps switching between being
annoyed when he's babied (by Mrs. Weasley or other adults), and crediting
everything to luck precisely because he *does not* seek fame.

This does not mesh well with the ambition that Slytherin is known for to me.
Indeed, Harry's loyalty to his friends, his willingness to forgive them with
very little in the way of a real apology, and readiness to risk everything for
them speaks more strongly of Hufflepuff than any of his actual actions do of
Slytherin.

Originally I thought that Rowling tried too hard to force the parallel between
Harry and Riddle, playing up that Harry could have been in Slytherin but for his
choices.  A different theory was presented in an interview.[^200731-3]  The
Sorting Hat accidentally attempted to sort *Riddle* and not *Harry* in
attempting the placement in Slytherin.  The Sorting Hat was not intended to sort
a person with a bit of someone else's soul in them.  This confused the hat, and
as a result it wasn't sure which person's traits to sort based on.  The hat, not
being truly alive, is not really able to reconsider or learn, so it stands by
its opinions.  It will do so until/unless it were to be placed on Harry's head
after the bit of Riddle's soul is removed.

In short, perhaps the boy that Harry *could* have been - abused as he was in
reality - should have shown more Slytherin tendencies, but the actual Harry that
we see in the books would make a *really really poor* Slytherin, a fairly good
Hufflepuff, and an uncertain Ravenclaw (depending on how much he would have been
willing to use that "not a bad mind" mentioned above away from Ron's influence).

### Relationships

See my overview on [[Shipping]].  The problem is that the series is, with very
very few exceptions, third-person limited with a Harry point of view, *and*
skips around to show *mostly* only "significant" (ie the kind that history books
pivot on) moments in his life.  We do not see the bulk of his daily interactions
with anyone.  We never see him attending the Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw Quidditch game
for example.  Similarly it is not uncommon for the books to jump over weeks and
even occasionally (especially in the earlier books) months where nothing
significant happens.

This is a problem because it is in these non-significant times that Harry would
be growing in relationship with all the rest of his classmates, year mates, and
housemates.  He would be at meals with them, in the library working on
assignments around them, in the common room hanging out.  They are living in
close proximity for ten months of each year, it is really unrealistic to
decide that Harry knows nothing of them beyond the supper superficial stuff
that *we* know of them.

### Appearance

On a truly trivial note, the scene from [[Snape|adults/Snape]]'s memory showing
the confrontation after the OWL tests shows that James purposefully messed up
his hair.[^200710-1]  Harry's hair is unfix-ably messy.  Unfortunately, we know
that while James did mess up his hair, it was also unfix-ably untidy.[^200710-2]
The most likely explanation of this is that it is purely genetic, but lots of
authors have had fun speculating a magical origin for this hair.  I read one
idea that I found really amusing, that Harry's hair was a prank that James
played on Lily.[^200710-3]  As I said, the book 1 evidence probably contradicts
the theory, but it is a great one.
