As someone who grew up hearing stories of {{< wikipedia "Saint Blaise" >}}, I
was shocked to find name etymology sites telling me that it *is* often used as
a girl's name.[^220705-7]  I suppose this explains why so many people thought
that he was a she. 

[^220705-7]: Some examples:
    * <http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Blaize>
    * <https://nameberry.com/babyname/blaize/boy>
    * <https://www.thebump.com/b/blaize-baby-name> (it notes it is a boy's name, but see the graph further down).
