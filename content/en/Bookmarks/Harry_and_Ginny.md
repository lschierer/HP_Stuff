While [Ginny][] has flaws, I remain partial to this pairing.  Unfortunately fan
fiction rarely does it justice.

   * Comments: In general the idea that [Ron][] and [Hermione][] are part of some plot
     to deceive and monitor [Harry][] 24/7 is ludicrous.  Children simply are not
     capable of maintaining that level of deception.  This story however
     provides a reasonable explanation for the scenario.

   * Comments: In this story, [Harry][] does not trust Dumbledore after the
     revelations at the end of 5th year.  Remus steps up to take an active role
     in [Harry][]'s life, and [Ginny][] doesn't date Dean.  One of the notable features
     of this story is that amulets are made to allow [Ginny][] to siphon power from
     the other Weasleys.

   * Comments: This story features [Harry][] and [Ginny][], but is *really* about the
     failings of Dumbledore and Lupin.  What would have happened if Sirius had
     not seen the newspaper from Fudge, but rather died when Riddle raided
     Azkaban?

    * Published: 2009-03-20. Updated: 2012-06-14.
    * Comments: This bond story is one of the longer ones.  I really like the
      way it does [Molly][] and Percy, and their opposition to [Harry][] and
      [Ginny][].  I dislike some of the other choices the author has made
      though.  There is a bit of torturing characters to provide angst, and the
      setup to cause the whole scenario is a bit chaotic.  The author attempted
      to fix this with a prequel that, I think, actually managed to confuse
      things more.  

_[Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2456938)_
:   * Author: Ophiuchus
    * Published: 2005-06-27. Updated: 2005-08-07. 
    * Comments: This story ignores the concept of [Horcruxes][],
      and all the messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room
      in the Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
      trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like [Harry][] as a
      phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like
      is the trunks.

    * Published: 2015-10-09. Updated: 2015-10-19.
    * Comments: This story pre-dates [Ginny][]'s confidence around [Harry][]
      to his time in [Grimmauld Place]({{< relref "../Harrypedia/Grimmauld_Place" >}}) 
      rather than the slower and mostly off "screen" build-up that we see in
      the canonical story line.  Here [Ginny][] convinces and helps [Harry][] to
      prepare for his trial rather than rely on [Dumbledore][HpediaD1].
      This turns out to be for the best, as [Lucius][] is rather more openly
      active in this version.  It is unfortunate that the author did not
      develop this concept further.

_[Walk Away Without Noticing](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14040641/5/Walk-Away-Without-Noticing)_
:   * Author: Hippothestrowl 
    * Published: 2022-02-17. Updated: 2022-03-17.
    * Comments: This is one of the stories where [Harry][] sends his memories back
      in time.  Unlike most, this [Harry][] decides that he is best off using his
      memories to *not be noticed at all.*  A truly interesting twist.

_[The Harder Struggle](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326015)_
:   * Author: Ericfmc
    * Published: 2012-07-16. Updated: 2012-12-19.
    * Comments: This really focuses more on Ron and [Hermione][] than it does on
      [Harry][] and [Ginny][], and is one of the stories that, while sticking with
      canonical couples, leans towards [Hermione][] as world saviour and [Harry][] as
      *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would
      prefer a stronger [Ginny][]. 

_[Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746)_
:   * Author: hermyd
    * Published: 2009-08-02. Updated: 2010-09-07. 
    * Comments: Featuring a Manipulative but not evil Dumbledore, and a
      redeemable Snape, this one is a super-powered [Harry][] story with a bit of a
      twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

_[A Romance In Reverse](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12413357)_
:   * Author: DukeBrymin
    * Published: 2017-03-20
    * Comments: I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this
      one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written
      in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it
      fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that [Harry][] and [Ginny][] have met
      before, and so when [Harry][] meets [Ron][] on the train, [Ron][] stalks
      off in a huff because he resents being viewed as [Ginny][]'s brother (he
      wants to stand out remember).  This leaves [Harry][] feeling very alone,
      so his wish at the Sorting is for a friend, and thus Hufflepuff.... and
      it all flows from there. 

_[Realizations][]_
:   * Author: sbmcneil
    * Published: 2012-02-26. Updated: 2017-07-15.
    * Comments: Despite its unfinished state, this is one of my favourite after
      the battle depictions.  One, I doubt Mrs. Weasley came face to face with
      that particular boggart made real without consequences.  Two, I do not
      think that Mrs. Weasley is ready for [Ginny][] to be in a relationship.
      Yes, in book three they talk about love potions,[^220711-1] but given her
      over-protective and overbearing nature, I do not think she will be ready
      for [Ginny][] to be in a *serious* romantic relationship until *she* sets
      said relationship up.  I suspect this remains true even if she would have
      otherwise approved of said relationship.  I also think that while [Ron][]
      shows a fair amount of character growth across the latter chapters of
      book seven, he and [Hermione][] have a lot further to go than [Harry][].
      This story gets all these things right.

:   * Author: CharmHazel
    * Published: 2016-10-18. Updated: 2016-10-20.
    * Comments: In many ways this is a shorter version of _[Realizations][]_.
      The Weasleys think of [Ginny][] as a little girl, therefore she cannot be
      in a serious relationship, therefore she isn't in one. [Harry][] broke up
      with her, therefore he isn't interested in her, so why would they be
      together?  These two statements sum up all the energy that is left when
      you are lost in grief.

:   * Author: sbmcneil
    * Published: 2012-07-03. Updated: 2017-05-06.
    * Comments: also unfortunately unfinished, this story is another great
      example of [Harry][] and [Ginny][]'s mutually supporting relationship.
      This one is AU in that they get together sooner, and Umbridge is able to
      expel them.  This also show cases [Dumbledore][D2]'s distrust of [Harry][] 
      and [Molly][] as overprotective.

:   * Author: sbmcneil
    *  Published: 2016-01-06. Updated: 2016-01-10.
    * Comments: Yet another work by this author, this one has the premise that
      [Hermione][] does not actually get along with [Ginny][], and that
      [Percy][PW1] is not any more happy with his family's association with
      [Harry][] after the war than he was during it.

      [Harry][] and [Ginny][] just *fit*.

_[Teatime in the Garden](https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=8935)_
:   * Author: LadyTonks
    * Published: 2005-10-05
    * Comment: Few stories deal with the possibility that [Harry][] might get
      permanently hurt in the final confrontation with [Riddle][].  This
      story does.

_[His Motivation](https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12615)_
:   * Author: _kb_ 
    * Published: 2007-03-04.
    * Comment: This one is slightly more optimistic about the ability to use
      magic to help [Harry][] recover.  Memories are used as a form of therapy
      to assist in recovery from catastrophic brain injury.

_[Mutant Storm][]_
:   * Author: [Bobmin](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356)
    * Published: 2011-09-22. Updated: 2011-09-26.
	* Comment: This is an {{< wikipedia "X-Men" >}} crossover story, and while
	  I do not think the author *quite* pulled off the bit about despair as a
	  trigger for mutant powers, it remains a story I keep coming back to.

_[Disembodied](https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129752)_
:   * Author: V for Vendetta
    * Published: 2013-09-05. Updated: 2013-09-27.
    * Comments: This short and entirely alternate universe work is amusing.
      [Harry][] has magiced himself *out of his body* and [Ginny][] decides to
      take him in for no real reason?  Totally doesn't make much sense, but
      highly amusing.

_[Forced Maturity Part I: The Chamber of Secrets](https://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442)_
:   * Author: pseudonym
    * Published: 2007-11-20. Updated: 2010-01-22.
    * Comments: I have always wished this were the first of a series.  In this,
      [James][] and [Lily][] are able, despite being dead, to induce a dream of
      what *might be* in [Harry][], said dream being the six books covering
      years two through seven.  The alternate universe kicks in because in this
      story, trauma causes magical children to mature faster in odd ways.

_[Learning To Fly](https://fictionhunt.com/stories/18vxmr3)_
:   * Author: hgfan1111
    * Published: 2008-06-01. Updated: 2022-08-26.
    * Comments: I think what I like about this one is that I can see where it
      comes from.  I sincerely believe that [Ron][] and his brothers *would*
      have reacted poorly to the idea of [Harry][] and [Ginny][] dating if
      [Harry][] had not utterly surprised them with his show of affecting for
      her after the quidditch match in book six.  I believe the intervention is
      entirely realistic, as is [Harry][]'s response to it.

_[Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always][]_
:   * Author: deadwoodpecker
    * Published: 2008-02-28. Updated: 2018-09-28.
    * Comments: I do not often like either redeamed [Snape][] nor books with
      Albus Severus, and this book and its sequel contain both.  Despite that,
      I do enjoy it.  This book has one plot element that I particularly like,
      [Harry][] crafts runes that amplify the power of the sacrifice he makes when
      he allows [Riddle][] to kill him.
