For some reason this pairing is incredibly rare, and even more rarely are these
stories actually finished.  I am unsure why, as Cho's character in the cannon
books is clearly not a good romantic match for Harry, and yet the introduction
of chinese culture allows for some interesting crossovers, or at least minor
additions to the canon universe.

      dangerous of the three Hallows.  This story explains one way that is
      true.
