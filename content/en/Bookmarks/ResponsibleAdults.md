So often children's literature is possible because the adults in those stories
are incompetent.  Sometimes they are well-meaning, sometimes they are not,
sometimes they are *trying* and failing, other times they are effectively
negligent.  Sometimes they are simply effectively absent.  Irregardless, the
story is only possible because children are doing things that adults should
have taken care of.  The Harry Potter series is no exception, though it differs
from many in that it features adults in *all* of these categories.  

This is a collection of fan fiction stories that are note-worthy primarily
because they showcase some aspect of adults being â€¦ adults. 

_[Harry Potter and the Burning of Bridges](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13279982)_

    * Comments:  This is a series of one-shots, so it is tempting to bookmark
      individual chapters.  The first chapter features a responsible Poppy
      Pomphrey taking Hagrid to task over the dragon.  Some of the following
      chapters are simply silly, but chapter 5 is mildly interesting, and 6-7
      have some interesting nuggets in them.  Chapter 8 is a disturbing might
      have been. 

_[Lessons Learned](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12399401)_
:   * Author: The Mother Rose
    * Published: 2017-03-10.
    * Comments: This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
      [Dursleys][] looking back and explaining to a younger relative how it is
      that he, and the rest of the neighbourhood, came to overlook [Harry][]'s
      living situation.  It then enters the Responsible Adult alternate universe
      by positing that people might have realised that Petunia was lying about
      [Harry][]'s secondary schooling and treated him like a missing child.
      This story is noteworthy because prior to reading this, despite the fact
      that I am, or ought to be (based on my own rants on the topic), fully
      aware of just how caste based English society can be, I had overlooked
      just how effective Petunia's lies would have been to that audience. 

_[The Paths Diverge](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7247199)_
:   * Author: Vaneria Potter
    * Published: 2011-08-03. Updated: 2019-01-23.
    * Comments: What would happen if someone saw [Harry][] between when he was
      left in the basket outside the [Dursleys][] and when Petunia found him the
      next morning?  While most people who stay in the magical world may not
      have an ounce of logic, not all *do* stay, and one woman without magic can
      do more that most magicals expect anyway. 

_[Petrification Proliferation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467)_
:   * Author: White Squirrel
    * Published: 2015-05-22. Updated: 2016-05-29.
    * Comments: In this story a [basilisk][] is treated as a weapon of mass destruction.  There are mandatory
      procedures in place that are actually followed.  

_[The Boy Who Never Knew](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6681967)_
:   * Author: dunuelos
    * Published: 2011-01-24. Updated: 2011-02-02.
    * Comments: What if Vernon and Petunia *didn't* hide the letter, and thus
      Hagrid *wasn't* [Harry][]'s first introduction to magic?  In this story,
      Tom the bar keep is that introduction, just as the Leaky Cauldron
      officially opens.  Hufflepuff [Harry][] spends the year keeping his head
      down and isolated from the rest of the school, only to be suddenly
      attacked by [Riddle][]'s wraith at the end of the year.  As a Hufflepuff,
      he has rather more of a support network than as a Gryffindor.  This really
      should have been developed at least a chapter or two further.  Some key
      things are left unanswered, but it is an intriguing start unfortunately
      marked complete.

_[The Three Professors Visit No 4 PrivetDrive](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11934019)_
:   * Author: Priya Ashok
    * Published: 2016-05-07.
    * Comments: This one features an out of character [Snape][].  I am unsure
      how much of his speech patterns are an affectation of the role he is
      playing, and how much is the author's interpretation of the character.  If
      the former, it is brilliant, if the latter, it is a flaw.  It would
      require a second chapter were we see Snape talking to others to begin to
      figure out which is going on though.  What makes this one memorable is the
      back and forth between [Snape][] and Petunia, with [McGonagall][]'s
      introspection interspersed.  Petunia does a masterful job of *destroying*
      [Dumbledore][HpediaD1] and McGonagall, only to be equally *destroyed* by
      [Snape][].  Meanwhile [McGonagall][] shows that underneath all that
      tarnish there really is some silver by realising that much of what is
      happening is deserved on all sides.  

_[Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978)_
:     * Author: White Squirrel
      * Published 2016-05-23. 
      * Comments: Considering British Common Law does not have a concept of
        Emancipated Minors, I rather doubt that either Wizarding Law or Goblin
        law does.[^221214-2]  Other than that Americanism, much of this work is
        a very much needed critical look of what would happen if the non-magical
        world actually *did* decide to intervene in the Harry Potter books.
        Overall, I suspect it is reasonably accurate. 

_[Defending Sirius Black](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7911105/)_
:     * Author: Luiz4200
      * Published: 2021-03-10. Updated: 2012-04-21.
      * Comments: This is one of several works by this author in which [Vernon][]
        directly or indirectly pushes for [Sirius][] to have a trial as a means
        of getting rid of [Harry][].  I include in it in this section because
        he is, whatever his motives, forcing the other adults to act
        responsibly, however unwillingly they do so.

_[Downfall of Snape](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13338897/1/Downfall-of-Snape)_
:     * Author: cornholio4
      * Published: 2019-07-16.
      * Comments: This one-shot shows that things could have been quite
        different if nearly any adult had been willing to take responsibility
        for dealing with [Snape][]'s behaviour towards students.

_[Blindsided](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13455367)_
:     * Author: MBurris
      * Published: 2019-12-18. Updated: 2021-04-21.
      * Comments: I am reluctantly putting this story into this category.  While
        the story features a number of incredibly irresponsible adults,
        ultimately [Hermione][] is, although I doubt she realises it, able to
        succeed because she ends up in the care of a few who do, for a variety
        of reasons, take some level of responsibility.  The most interesting
        things about this story is the detailed thought that has gone into
        addressing both [Hermione][] as a flawed character and the wizarding
        culture into which she enters.  While I dislike a few of the author's
        decisions, I *really* like some of the author's ideas on the culture,
        and the honest look at [Hermione][] is refreshing, especially for an
        author who features her so prominently.

     * Comments: [Legally Blonde](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250494/) might
       have been made for a Harry Potter crossover.  A lawyer who cannot quite
       fit in totally fits in with the way Mrs. Rowling depicts wizards as
       being unable to quite grasp non-magical fashion.   The contrast between
       [Elle Woods][] and [Umbridge][] is incredibly funny.  I have seen this
       tried a few other times, but none do it quite so well.
