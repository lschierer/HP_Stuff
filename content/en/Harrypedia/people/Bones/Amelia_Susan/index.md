## Physical Appearance

> A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudgeâ€™s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding.[^221213-3] 

She has a "booming" voice.[^221213-5]

## More Generally About Her

We know very little about Amelia Bones from cannon sources.  [Tonks][] says
that she is fair, and thinks well of her.[^221213-2]  And sure enough, she is
the only one to follow up on the evidence that [Harry][] presents at his
trial.[^221213-4]  Despite that, she allows there to *be* a trial, and until
this book, we do know know that there *is* a head of Magical Law Enforcement,
because [Fudge][] appears to be doing the job.[^221213-6]  This does not speak
well of her control over her department, her political influence, or the
respect with which she might be held.

## Pure Speculation

There are a couple of prevailing opinions of Amelia across the fandom.  

1. Tonk's good opinion is justified, but the Ministry is so corrupt that she is
   effectively powerless.
1. She herself is politically ambitious and willing to make the moral
   sacrifices that go with that ambition.  The difference between her and
   [Dumbledore][] is really only who happens to be in charge. 
1. She is so incredibly bound up by her determination to follow the law that
   she is powerless to deal with those who circumvent it.  The wizarding world
   has too few checks and balances to even launch an effective internal
   investigation, and the corruption is so widespread that if you did
   successfully investigate, the trial would be a farce.  Because of this she
   ends up turning a blind eye to problems she cannot solve while holding a
   firm line to try to prevent things from getting worse.

These are not really mutually exclusive, but in practice in any given work, you
do not see all three, rather you see one of them, sometimes two of them to
differing extents.  This feels true to me.  I suspect that the right answer is
some combination of these ideas with the right proportions.

[^221213-6]: It is after all [Fudge][] who arrests [Hagrid][] and handles
  [Sirius][]' escape from Azkaban.  Surely these would normally be the job of a
  Head of Magical Law Enforcement, not the equivalent of the Head of State and
  Government?
