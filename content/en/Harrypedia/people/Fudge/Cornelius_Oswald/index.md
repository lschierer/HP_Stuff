### Speculation

I am hardly the first to note that it is decidedly odd how much that Fudge
handles personally as Minister of Magic.  Where is [Amelia Bones][] and the
rest of the [Department of Magical Law Enforcement][MLE] before [Umbridge][]
starts to misuse them? 

[MLE]: <{{< relref "Government" >}}>

[Amelia Bones]: <{{< relref "Amelia_Susan" >}}>

[Umbridge]: <{{< relref "Delores_Jane" >}}>

Specifically looking at both the arrest of [Hagrid][] and the handling of
[Sirius's][SB] escape, I strongly suspect that his actions are at best quasi-legal
and that [Dumbledore][] *could* have done more in both cases. 

[Hagrid]: <{{< relref "Rubeus" >}}>

[SB]: <{{< relref "Sirius_III" >}}>

[Dumbledore]: <{{< relref "Albus_Percival_Wulfric_Brian" >}}>

In the case of [Hagrid][], I suspect that Fudge is being fairly honest about
his motives.  *Some* news about the Chamber must have leaked out to the wider
Wizarding World (possibly via [Lucius][]), and Fudge feels that his popularity
numbers are suffering. Why [Dumbledore][] does not act is more complicated. 

[Lucius]: <{{< relref "Lucius_Abraxas" >}}>

The case of [Sirius][SB] is almost certainly more sinister.  Fudge was one of
the first on the scene,[^220906-3] and even as a "Junior Minister", probably
one of the more senior people actually on the scene.  As such he was probably a
key figure in the investigation, and *should* have been a key witness in the
trial.  Except that a trial did not happen.  Fudge *probably* rode his
"capture" of the "infamous" [Sirius Black][SB] in his upward climb that
resulted in his election to Minister of Magic.

### Criticising Other Authors

It is *extremely* common to portray [Bagnold][] as having retired almost
immediately after [Riddle][]'s first fall.  Depending on the author, Fudge was
either a dark horse candidate because the government was otherwise gridlocked
between opposing parties, he was [Dumbledore][]'s hand picked choice, or
[Malfoy][]'s equally hand picked choice.  None of these fits the facts.  As
noted above, Fudge did not become Minister until 1990, which explains why he
was so unsure of himself in his role as minister throughout the first book.
