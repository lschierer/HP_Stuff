    blurb: Hogwarts Founded
    description: |
      Hogwarts was founded "over a thousand years" before HP2.
      The society the founders recruited students from would have
      included both Chrstians and papans.  Given [Bill]'s work in
      Egypt, I believe that before the [Statute of Secrecy], magic
      was woven into pagan societies, often as part of the priest
      classes.  While we have no direct support for this in cannon,
      it provides the best explanation of the things the [Weasleys]
      state they encounter in their trip to visit that country.
