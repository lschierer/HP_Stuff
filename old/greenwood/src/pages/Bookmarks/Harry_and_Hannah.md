I really feel that Hannah is an under utilised character in fan fiction. Sure
she backs down from her defence of him in second year and ends up wearing a
badge in fourth, but both of these essentially boil down to the fact that she
is a Hufflepuff and not a Gryffindor - she _isn't_ brave, and getting along
with (showing loyalty to) her housemates is _massively_ important to her. The
latter however can easily be transferred to Harry by a romantic attachment
overriding the House loyalty, as my first entry in this category does.

    <dd>Comments: This one is a really interesting story in many ways despite a
        few irritating flaws.  I dislike the relationship that Harry has with
        Hermione and, to a lesser extent, Ginny.  I think that his relationship
        with Hermione is in particular too romantically inclined, particularly in
        the earlier chapters.  I think the whole crucifixion scene is overboard;
        and lastly the obvious solution to the marriage contract it uses is
        breach of contract on the Patil's side.  I am unsure why the author did
        not go that route.  These things aside, the story is excellent, with some
        really strong ideas.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This is a really short one shot, but it had much potential to be
        developed into a longer story.  Like many of this author's stories, it
        focuses on how important a relationship with the right girl would be for
        Harry.  This one features a view of Hannah that lets the reader easily
        see her growth from the girl we seen in second year to the girl who we
        are told (semi-apocryphally) takes over the Leaky Cauldron.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: another one shot, the pairing is very much in the background
        here.  I almost included this in responsible adults instead.</dd>
