description: HP stories with Harry and Wednesday Addams paired
author: "Luke Schierer"

Harry Potter almost begs for a crossover with the Addams family, despite the
differences in timelines in any iteration of the Addams family. If you are
going to do such a crossover, pairing Harry with Wednesday is, or should be, a
foregone conclusion. Some of these stories are just stupid, slash and similar
themes abound, despite the fact that it is entirely unnecessary, and, frankly,
contrary to the original Addams source material. Despite that, there are some
real gems, some of which are even finished.

    <dd>Comments: This actually has a ton of crossovers, and I expect I would
        enjoy it more if I could follow more of them.  The pairing comes at the
        end, and is rather a capstone to the work.  Despite that, I think it fits
        in this category, because it *feels* like an Addams story.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: Actually four separate stories (for the first four years), this
        unfinished work makes you fall in love with the Addams family.  There is
        this weird "good and evil do not exist" thing, but you can sort of see
        how the author decided on that from the original Addams material.  If you
        can get past that, this is an excellent read that will leave you wishing
        for more.</dd>
