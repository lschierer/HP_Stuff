## Overall Rules

### power levels

Nephil can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) for access to each class
of [angelic abilities][abt].[^221216-2] This naturally means that for many of 
the pivotal characters, I have [mathematical notes on their power levels][AD]. For 
the purposes of this work:

[AD]: <../appendix_d>

[abt]: <#abilities-by-type>

[^221216-2]: I have seen other fan fiction authors rate magical power on a
    mathematical scale, but not in the granular way I am.  These works include,
    but may not be limited to:

This begs the question "What do you mean by expected?"  Obviously there is no
standards body anywhere in the world that is grading students using these
categories.  The nephil in this world have not accepted that they are descended
from angels, and thus do not think of their abilities in terms of the angelic
choirs.  What I mean is that, given adequate but not necessarily superlative instruction, someone who does not meet the stated goal is being
lazy, suppressing their abilities, or both.  They are neglecting their own
strengths.  

### abilities by type

I have categorised each classical type of angel as having originally created a
different type of nephil, which in my notes I call "primordial nephil."  My
intention, however, is that these types are not different species, but rather
more like having different traits that can be independently inherited.  Each
angelic order is described below as per the Areopagite model.[^220628-4] I then
follow that description with how their powers/nature have been inherited by
nephil.

#### Seraphim
* These angels perceive God most directly, and know him in and as Himself best.
* In the fusion with the material, the nephil has lost the ability to
  perceive God directly.  However, as man is a limited image of God, the nephil
  has the ability to perceive the heart of the man/nephil.  When used on other
  nephil, this allows access to information about the person's physical
  state, their will, and their memories.  When used on humans, it allows only
  access to information about the person's physical state.  However, an
  astute judge of human nature can combine this with situational awareness,
  historical information about the person, body language, and similar data to
  make highly accurate guesses.

#### Cherubim
* These angels perceive God only indirectly, but understand that perception
  best.  Their work is the contemplation of God through His works.
* The nephil inherits the the ability to perceive/detect what has been done
  with magic, and what is possible with it.  This is a more passive ability
  than is inherited from any other choir, and could be confused with the
  mastery granted by inheriting a power level of 10 from the other choirs.
  The difference is that the Cherub's child really does not even need to be
  taught to the extent they inherit.  You will find no class in Hogwarts
  about detecting "spell residue" or similar ideas found in other fan fiction
  works, because you can either do this without training or you cannot.  
    
#### Thrones
* The Thrones contemplate Judgement.
* While the Thrones, like the Seraphim, are primarily contemplative, the
  inheritance from them is, again like that from the Seraphim, much more
  active.  The nephil has the ability to bind the will of other nephilim, and
  to defend against being so bound.  For the purposes of this story, and
  *unlike cannon Harry Potter*, this ability has marginal *at best* effect on
  full humans. Things like the imperious curse or the confundus charm fit in
  here.  Thus fan fiction concepts like magical contracts are actually
  possible.[^221119-1]
    
#### Dominions
* These angels are responsible for ordering the work of all other angels.
  Their name implies actual, real authority. 
* The relationship between the way Dominions operate and the abilities the
  nephilim gain is somewhat indirect.  God creates by decree - He spoke and
  the world was made.  The nephilim are not capable of true creation, but
  have authority only over the *form*,but not the substance, of the material
  world.  They can thus by their magic transmute the form of one thing to
  another.  This will be temporary unless the change is "locked" in place
  through combining this ability with that inherited from the Powers. Neither
  alone can make a transmutation permanent.  That is, the Powers cannot
  retroactively make a transmutation permanent, it must be done *as the change
  is made, by the same nephil*.

#### Virtues
* The Virtues are responsible for enforcing the laws of physics.  Traditional
  sources tell us that they generally concern themselves primarily with
  massively macroscopic effects, but I cannot understand them in any other
  way.  My personal theory, which will naturally be used here, is that
  actually *doing* anything with the way physical laws work at a microscopic
  and sub-microscopic level would be either catastrophic, unduly influence
  free will for those affected by it, or both.  
* The nephil inherits the ability to temporarily augment the nature of the
  natural world. Things like animation charms fit here, but so do things like
  levitation charms. The other thing that fits here is that when a nephil who 
  inherits from the Virtues handles certain raw materials (potions ingredients), 
  these become "charged" with extra properties.  This is a deviation from Mrs. 
  Rowling's explanation for potions.  Like the magic inherited from the 
  Dominions, the magic inherited from the Virtues is highly temporary.  Indeed, 
  these effects generally last only for the duration the nephil is actively 
  providing magic.  

#### Powers
* Powers are the first of the overtly militant angelic orders (looking from
  top down).  They protect the work of the Virtues from interference.  This,
  to me, implies that God providentially foresaw that giving angels free will
  would entail a universe in which that free will was exercised in wrong
  ways. 
* The nephil inherits the ability to affect time.  When used directly on the
  natural world, this results in things like time turners on one hand, but
  also stasis charms on the other.  Divination is *not* included in this
  ability, that is something different.  When used on a magical effect, you
  can make it last longer (even permanently) or shorter (a finite incantatem
  charm for example totally cancels it).  The relationship to this and the
  parent angel's ability is indirect.  What would a nephil inherit from an
  order whose work is to interfere with the work of fallen angels? I decided
  that preserving/extending and/or shortening/ending magical effects is a
  good way to go.  Playing with Time to do so links them more closely with
  the Dominions and Virtues, and thus fits with the three groups of three
  thing that traditional sources of information on angels give us.

#### Principalities
* The principalities are concerned with groups of people - nations, cities,
  clubs, ethnic groups.  They are not concerned with the individual, but with
  the common good.  
* The nephil inherits the ability to create area effects on populations and
  places (unplottable, "muggle repelling", so on). This differs from the
  Thrones in that the gifts from the Thrones affect individuals regardless of
  location.  The gifts from the Principalities affect whoever, full human or
  nephil, is in the right location to be affected, and no one who is not in
  relationship to that location.  Your ability to see into a place, remember
  place, stay near a place, so on.  This magic must be continuously powered
  in some way.  See the Powers above, and Runes below.

#### Archangels
* These angels are tasked with particular goals in particular times and
  places.  Heal this person, protect that person, deliver this message.  They
  accomplish concrete tasks on God's behalf, with whatever force is required
  to do so.
* The nephil's inheritance is again indirect.  The Archangels exercise
  visible force, the nephil gains the ability to use magic to enforce his
  will.  Again, there is some potential confusion with the prior orders.  The
  Thrones affect the will of the person either directly (other nephil) or
  indirectly (humans).  The target then causes an effect.  The Archangel's
  child causes visible effects, these effects have the affect of forcing
  others to obey.  The Principalities' children also overlap some, but their
  children are not affecting any *particular* person with their effects, nor
  does the use of this magic result in a visible effect.  Recall that the
  nephilim come from fallen angels, so some of these offensive magics are
  corrupted and should not be used.  This is not to say that all harm is
  always bad, but some magic requires a mindset that is inherently twisted. 

#### Angels
* Also called Guardian Angels, these angels are tasked with the welfare of
  specific individuals in a general sense.  They differ from the Archangel who
  has a particular goal to achieve in time and space in that the Guardian
  Angel is concerned with the *moral* state of its assigned person.  The
  Guardian Angel is concerned with salvation.
* The inheritance from the nephil is the ability to resist magical force, of
  any kind, from any other class of magic.  Shield spells, spells to undue
  effects (which differs from stopping the duration very slightly but
  significantly).   This is not, however, necessarily safe magic.  These can
  also be corrupted to the point of being dangerous to the user.  A defensive
  measure might still warp the mind/soul of the user; it might effectively be
  resisting too much, or the wrong way.  For example in the physical world I
  can drown out a voice by being louder, by covering my ears, or by
  puncturing my ear drums.   While the last is extreme, and only a crazy
  person would do it, well, remember that nephil do not always understand how
  their magic affects them.

[^221119-1]: As stated elsewhere in these Appendices, I believe the existence
   of magical contracts is actually *implied* by the canonical Harry Potter
   books.  However, I am not going to debate their canonicity here.  For the
   purposes of this work, they exist.

## mapping to Harry Potter

Harry Potter cannon breaks magic down into:

### charms
* generally a mix of inheritance from Virtues and Powers for the lower years,
  however
  - things like "cheering charms" are _actually_ a form of transmutation
    manipulating the form of brain chemicals, and thus, temporarily, their
    effect.
  - memory charms like obliviation are a mix of transmutation on brain
    chemicals with the Seraphic ability to perceive (and thus target the
    transmutation really precisely). Because they are chemical in nature, they
    can work on full humans.  However, they can be more precisely targeted and
    more finely crafted/tuned when used against a nephil.  Thus you can make a
    human forget, say, the last hour, or the last day; you can make a nephil
    forget that a single person was present while otherwise remembering the
    event.
  - Imperious curse acts differently on humans and nephil. Using the
    imperious curse on a human will require "operating" that human like you
    would a puppet or a remote control robot, while using it on a nephil acts
    more like what you see in the Harry Potter books, where you can give a
    command and the victim's own mind will assist in finding ways to carry out
    the order.
  - Confundus type charms only work well on nephil, because they extend memory
    charms by depending on abilities inherited from Thrones. When used on a
    human, this charm interferes with the ability to form a long term memory,
    and the ability to retrieve long term memories, both for the duration of
    the charm, and it causes the various chemicals in the brain to surge.  So
    humans will tend to end up all sorts of confused, but without the fine
    grained control over what they are confused about, or what they think is
    actually happening that you can achieve with a nephil.  Note that not all
    nephil are *aware* of the difference in affect here.

### transfiguration
* comes primarily from the Dominions, but is highly temporary unless you use
  abilities from the Powers to extend (perhaps infinitely) the duration *as
  you make the change*.
  - Gramp's Law is problematic.  As noted in the [Harry Potter Wiki][HPW1],
    even Gramp's Law's exceptions seem to have exceptions, for example wine
    can be conjured.[^220718-1] For my purposes the problems are two fold: 
    * transfiguration is temporary by default.  Your transfigured food will
      revert.  For something like water into wine, that is not actually a
	  problem.  For something like a sandwich, you would now have a block o
	  wood (if you transfigured it out of wood) instead of something digestible.
    * Successful *permanent* transfiguration means transmuting the actual
      substance all the way down to the subatomic level.  Few of the nephilum
      know *anything* to the level of detail required for this to be
	  successful, and where they do, it tends to be fairly pure elements,
	  like raw iron into raw gold.  But even then, combining your
	  transmutation with the Powers magic necessary to make it permanent is
	  poorly understood, thus poorly taught, and so see the prior point.

### Defence
* I am mostly taking [Ishtar][]'s position from _[The Case of the Missing
  Wizard][TCMW1]_ but with a twist.  Much of the content in this class is, as 
  Ishtar would have it, a mix of Charms, Runes, Transfiguration, Care of Magical
  Creatures, and so on.  However, some of it, particularly as it comes to the
  study of specific counter curses and shields, comes from the Angels.  Some of
  it, where actual offensive spells are taught (such as the knockback jinx),
  comes from the Archangels.  
* As I see it, this class is a mishmash of content, part learning about
  "dark" creatures, part learning about the curses you are defending against
  (except not practising casting them), part learning about the counters to those
  curses, and part learning about avoiding the need to ever use those counter
  curses.  Since many spells *can* be used either offensively or defensively,
  but are not *inherently* combat related, this class is pulling from all
  sorts of branches of magic.

### animagus
* In the Harry Potter books, this is a form of transfiguration enabled by the
  use of a ritual that combines a repeated spell with a potion.  The article
  on Uagadou[^220628-5] implies, but does not outright state, that in the
  cannonical books there are ways to influence what animal you become.
  Synchronised transformation does not make a ton of sense unless they did so
  *to the same target animal*, but the magical world *doesn't* always make
  sense.  Either way, in this story there are different ways to "become" an
  animagus.  In fact, it would be more accurate to say "unlock" the ability,
  as this is not actually an ability inherited via one of the powers
  enumerated above, but a separate inheritance common no matter what
  rank/choir of angel(s) one descends from.   Students of the Uagadou school
  use powers meld abilities from the Thrones, the Powers, and the Dominions
  to transmute their own nature to the desired animal (or animals), so that
  when they exercise the inherit animagus ability, they become an "unnatural"
  animal.  Few ever realise how invasive this transmutation is to their sense
  of self.  Other cultures have other ways of unlocking this ability, some of
  which are safer than others.

### conjuring
* requires inheritance from the Powers, as you are in essence manipulating
  quantum probabilities.  No nephil *actually* understands how conjuring
  *actually* works.  You have manipulated time in a highly localised (nearly
  negligible) space until it becomes probable that quanta will appear in the
  desired configuration, and more, that this has *actually happened* (and not
  some other quantum affect).  Unlike the standard Harry Potter, conjuration
  will tend to be permanent.  Gramp's Law again comes into play, but see the
  note above about needing to understand your target down to the elemental
  level for it to end up being digestible. A comfortable chair does not need
  to be so accurate, because we expect it to remain a chair.  A sandwich we
  expect our bodies to *break down* into the constituent molecules, which
  thus *have to be there*. 

### Vanishing
* though considered transfiguration, this is actually a really weird mix of
  abilities from Virtues and Powers.  Like conjuring, no nephil *correctly*
  understands it.  You are essentially making the thing vanished air
  soluble, then for the space that thing occupies, manipulating time such
  that it appears to have instantly dissolved.  Because it is explained so
  poorly, students new to the practice will often actually attempt to modify
  the physical properties of the thing being vanished instead of its chemical
  properties, resulting in transparent versions instead of something that
  has, to paraphrase McGonagall, gone into everything.

### Potions
* These are complicated.  The magic comes in part from the brewer (primarily
  from the Virtues), and in part from the ingredients (different ingredients
  will react to your magical influence in different ways).  No two nephil will
  affect ingredients precisely the same way; similarly no two instances of the
  same ingredient are actually precisely the same.  A strong ability inherited
  from the Cherubim will make you more able to discern the effects of the
  ingredients, including between instances of supposedly identical
  ingredients. Thus the best potioneers strongly inherit from both the
  Cherubim and Virtues. Some potions additionally require chemical reactions
  not possible in nature, this requires the potioneer to have abilities in the
  Power to make a probabilistic reaction happen in the desired time frame.
  Alternately, the potioneeer can transmute the form of one ingredient to
  make it chemically react the desired way.  Lastly, if a potion is to be
  stored, rather than used immediately, the effects must be locked in place
  *at the time of creation*, again an ability coming from the Powers.

* Potions is a wandless art, though some traditions *do* use incantations as
  part of the process to assist the potioneer to trigger their magic.
  Hogwarts teaches potions in its hardest form: both wandless and silent,
  requiring near instinctual use of effectively three to four forms of magic
  simultaneously.  The nephil must use abilities inherited from the Virtues
  to augment the ingredients with additional properties, locking the
  augmentation in place using the time magic from the Powers(endless
  duration).  As this highly personal process will result in something
  slightly different from nephil to nephil, he/she must use abilities from
  the Cherubim to pick precisely the ingredients affected by his/her magic to
  precisely the right degree and in precisely the right way.  Should the
  ingredients not want to mix, the nephil then uses abilities inherited from
  either the Dominions or the Virtues, either transmuting the form of the
  ingredient into something that can mix, or to manipulate the laws of
  chemistry to make the reaction possible. The different ways and patterns of
  stirring are essentially mental triggers to help the nephil activate their
  magic.  This means that a potion recipe is more of a suggestion than a true
  recipe, the best will always come from deviating from the recipe by *just
  the right amount* to account for your personal magic and the specific
  ingredients you happen to be using in this particular instance.

### Runes
* These are also complicated.  Runes are _created_ from powers inherited from
  the Virtues, you augment reality to give your writing not just meaning, but
  power.  They are, however, *powered* by the inheritance from the Powers,
  (investing an element of long duration to the rune created).  Thus two
  people equally skilled at creating runes might not be equally skilled at
  powering those runes, or vice versa.  This is also a deviation from the
  cannon Harry Potter universe.  Runes can also be created to *absorb* power
  from the surrounding area to power connected sequences of runes, using
  abilities inherited from the Principalities, instead of being pre-charged
  via the Powers.  This in practice reduces the effect of any attempt to use
  other powers in any way not connected to that rune sequence.  For a school
  like Hogwarts, it would be safer to practice your magic because the effect
  of each spell would be lessened.  The Hospital Wing would need to be
  shielded from most of the runes protecting the rest of the castle to ensure
  that you could still be cured using magic at full efficacy.  Overall, this
  effect would bolster Hogwart's reputation for being one of the safest places
  in Britain.

* Runes are an ancient form of magic dating from a period when most nephil
  only had one or perhaps two of the different ranks of angels in his or her
  ancestry, and thus access to only a subset of the abilities of a "modern"
  (blended) nephil.  By acting cooperatively, one person crafting the rune
  and another powering it, each specialising in the subset of runes that
  matched their magic, they could together create affects that none could
  create alone.  The use of runes persists into the modern era in part
  because the effects created by these "primordial" nephilim are still
  encountered by the "modern" magical society, and in part because they
  remain an efficient and effective way of combining one's own inheritance
  from the Powers with Virtues, Dominions, Principalities, Angels, and/or
  Thrones.  This is especially true when, as is almost universally the case,
  the nephil in question does not even understand these as the true way to
  classify magic.

### Divination
* This magic has two categories.
  - prophesy is a morally flawed magic.  I am going to go with Biblical
    theology here; in divination the nephil knowingly or unknowingly
    communicates with fallen angels.  If they ever tell anything truthful, it
    is only because they judge it useful to lead us further into sin. Thus
    most prophesies are misleading, false, or both.  This fits well with what
    Mrs. Rowling writes in her original FAQ when she compared her series'
    prophecy to the one from _Macbeth_.[^20210902-5]
  - Users particularly skilled in the abilities from the Seraphim may be able
    to use these abilities to make incredibly accurate predictions about
    people without crossing any lines.  Knowing that someone is clumsy from
    their memories, knowing that someone is afraid from their emotions, the
    user can predict some short term events and reactions in ways that might
    seem like divination.  Practices like palm reading, tea leaves, and
    crystal gazing grew from this magical insight into people
  - There is some crossover between the two, generally to the detriment of
    both the user and any understanding of the truth.

* Users of the first form make future generations more susceptible to magics
  inherited from the Seraphim and Thrones (for four generations per my rules
  on nephil [inheritance][AC].  So while in general someone strong in the 
  Thrones could normally resist the imperious curse, if they come from a family 
  steeped in the use of divination, then he/she personally will be abnormally 
  susceptible to this magic.

### Arithmancy
* This has a Wikipedia definition as being a speciality of divination.  For my
  purposes this is _almost_ true.  For my purposes Arithmancy attempts to
  predict the effect of a use of magic.  It attempts to make magic scientific.
  However, it is complicated by the fact that its practitioners themselves do
  not actually understand the scientific method, nor agree on which
  mathematical system(s) they are using to do this in.  The field is dominated
  by people with only the vaguest idea of what the mundane world has done with
  either numbers or science in the past 400 years.

### Legilimency
* This requires both an inheritance from the Seraphim and the Thrones, for
  this work it comes in 3 phases.
  - Passively, it is solely from the Seraphim, and is morally neutral. This
    will tell you a target's emotional state (anything related to brain
    chemistry), whether or not the person is telling the truth (again based on
    brain chemistry and things like pulse rates, but done automatically for
    you by the magic), energy level/alertness, and other purely physical
    things but _not_ about the person's actual thoughts or memories. A really
    skilled user may be able to infer thoughts from this however with a fair
    degree of accuracy.
  - Unidirectionally Outbound, it adds in abilities from the Thrones, forcing
    the recipient to hear your thoughts. This is a bit of a grey area morally.
  - Actively, you force the victim to reveal their memories, implant memories,
    or manipulate emotional states.  For some unknown reason, unless the
    target has at least some magic, you will be unable to do more than
    manipulate emotional states.  This manipulation goes beyond the simple
    transmutation of brain chemicals, it actually causes the brain to release
    the appropriate chemicals as if naturally in that emotional state. All
    active legilimency is morally repugnant, and comes at a magical cost.

* Excessive use of this form of legilimency will have bizarre effects.  The
  effects may be physical, spiritual, mental, or any combination thereof.
  Per the above, what constitutes "excessive" has not been quantified.  To
  the extent that the use is not just excessive but also malicious and/or
  selfish in nature, the effects will not only be bizarre but hereditary,
  *and* will be coupled with reduced will-power in subsequent generations
  as is described in the section of magical inheritance for magics
  requiring emotional content.

### Occlumency
* The magical suppression of emotion and with that access to thoughts comes at
  similar moral and magical cost to active legilimency.  This is a prime
  example of a defensive magic that harms the user.  This story will offer
  magical defences to legilimency besides that of occlumency, these defences
  may or may not exist in and/or be implied by the canonical Harry Potter
  books.

### Contracts
* As I said in the [Appendix A][AA], Mrs. Rowling set up a world in which you
  can be unwillingly bound to obey a contract.  Any number of writers have
  used this to set up Harry in a marriage contract.  [Wikipedia][] claims
  that arranged marriages were common in much of the world as late as the
  18th century.[^220823-1]  It stands to reason that not every couple went to
  the alter willingly in every case, and that some of the darker nephil
  parents would explore means to coerce compliance.  These contracts are thus
  part of the cultural history that pure bloods inherit, as well as part of
  the history of the relationship between nephilim and the Catholic Church.
  How would the Church handle someone validly married who is now magically
  forced to marry someone else?  
* See [Appendix F][AF] for specifics on contracts.
* See [Appendix G][AG] for more on how the Church was affected. 
* See [Appendix H][AH] for more on why this works on nephilim.  
* Structurally speaking, how this works depends on the nature of the contract.
  - A written contract is (unknown to the nephilim) essentially a highly modern
    form of runes.  You use magic inherited from the Virtues to give your 
    writing power, in this case power inherited from the Thrones to compel the 
    will of those bound by the contract.  The contract may be further infused 
    by the Powers to give it duration, or may depend on the existence of the 
    paper contract to ensure its persistence.  Different subsets of nephilim 
    may or may not have realised that destroying the physical contract will 
    (in some cases)	destroy the magical contract.
  - Per [Appendix F][AF], no matter how skilful or powerful the author, no 
    contract is as successful at binding the will as an [Imperius] curse. See 
    the caveat in [Appendix F][AF].  Nephilim, not understanding that fine
    grained condition, do not understand why some contracts work and others do
    not.
  - In this universe, he Goblet of Fire, were it ever carefully inspected, has
    hidden runes lightly scratched around and inside it spelling out the terms of the contract
    it enforces. These scratches have been preserved and protected by the
    application of still more magic reinforced by the case the Goblet is
    stored in between Triwizard Tournaments.  Modern users have not taken
    the time to carefully inspect either.
  - Other forms of 'contract' magic leverage the mutable nature of the nephilim
    rather than relying on the power of the thrones.  
    + These lack the versatility of written contracts, in that they cannot be 
      prepared in advanced by a skilled practitioner with fine-tuned terms, 
      conditions, effects, limitations, loop-holes, and all the other things 
      that a fallen people have wanted in their agreements over the centuries.
    + Similarly, the contract that lacks a physical representation cannot be
      used as flexibly, one can bind oneself or one's descendants, but not
      a pair of unknown and unrelated persons. 
    + Where the written contract uses the magic of the writer, these use the
      magic of those entering into them.
