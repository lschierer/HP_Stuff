An Ashwinder a magical serpent that is created from the remains of magical
fires that are allowed to burn unchecked.[^220725-1]  

This beast is a cunundrum as it apparently lays its eggs asexually, and does so
*at all* despite having spontaneously formed from the magic in unchecked
fires.[^220725-2]  These eggs, if frozen before they cause the combustion of
any adjacent object[^220725-3], are useful for love potions and as a cure for
the ague.[^220725-4]
