The unicorn dates back pretty much as far back as you care to go, though the
earliest references may in fact be talking about an auroch, a purely mundane
animal, and not a true unicorn.[^220726-1]  Several of the next most recent
accounts are fairly clearly describing, in turn, an oryx and a
rhinoceros.[^220726-2]  However, these accounts are considered the basis for the
animal in human accounts.[^220726-3]  It is in the second century that the
unicorn's docility in the presence of a maiden, or at least a virgin female
(unsure how old the girl can be and still count) are first
referenced.[^220726-4]  

Many healing potions use unicorn's horn, with the earliest accounts
demonstrating that the horn need not be willingly given.[^220726-5]  

It is unclear whether the unicorn is more goat-like or more horse like in
appearance, at one point did the scarcity of the beast and the separation of
the magical world start to blur the mundane accounts of the animal?[^220726-6]
