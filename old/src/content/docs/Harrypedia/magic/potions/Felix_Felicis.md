## Description

Makes the drinker lucky for a finite time.  They will experience extra-ordinary
success in all endevours while under its effects.  It causes giddiness,
recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence if taken in excess, and can even be
highly toxic if sufficient quantities are imbibed.  It requires six months to
stew before being ready.
