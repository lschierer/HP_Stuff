## Analysis

I doubt that [Tom Marvolo]'s father's first name was *actually* "Tom."  Given what I know of British society, it was almost certainly Thomas, with "Tom" being a nickname.  It is likely that [Merope] never knew that fact.  As such I am not listing him by this name here. 

[Tom Marvolo]: tom_marvolo/
