    Considering that this is an author whose worse I've read frequently, I am unsure how I missed this particular one for as long as I did.  This is [Clell65619]'s tribute to [Ron], an attempt to recompense a fictional character for fictional harm in other works. (Yes, that thought amuses me).  Considering the work itself, it is a crossover with the DC Comics universe, and offers more a summary of what happened across the series than a detailed view.  Still, it is enough to provide an amusing take on a much maligned (including by me) character.

    I'm starting off this list with an unfinished work.  I dislike
    bookmarking unfinished works, despite the fact that of late I have found
    myself doing so with some frequency. This one is of note for several reasons:

    * I *really* like the way it handles characterization.
      * The bad guys are both very clearly bad guys, and yet heros in their own minds for believable reasons.  Their children love them forbelievable reasons.  While there are a few true monsters, most of them are simply men corrupted by too much wealth and too much power fortoo many generations.  They are in over their heads, trying to preserve their power, their families, trapped between the loss of*everything* on one side and a monster ([Riddle]) on the other.
      * The good guys are equally flawed.  Ron himself has all the flaws we know from cannon.  His parents flaws are on full display.[Dumbledore] and [Harry] are called out for their flaws. So on and so forth. But they are not bashed either - everyone, to at least someextent, is a work in progress, adapting as the story grows. Some more so than others admittedly, the author clearly has some biases.
    * There is a great deal of thought in the world building.  Why are [goblins] greedy? How do [veela] affect people and why? Magic is rich,and complex.
