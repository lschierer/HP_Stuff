    This is an amusing short story that breezes through the years in summary form.

    This actually has a ton of crossovers, and I expect I would enjoy
    it more if I could follow more of them. The pairing comes at the end, and is
    rather a capstone to the work. Despite that, I think it fits in this
    category, because it *feels* like an Addams story.

    Actually four separate stories (for the first four years), this
    unfinished work makes you fall in love with the Addams family. There is this
    weird "good and evil do not exist" thing, but you can sort of see how the
    author decided on that from the original Addams material. If you can get
    past that, this is an excellent read that will leave you wishing for more.
