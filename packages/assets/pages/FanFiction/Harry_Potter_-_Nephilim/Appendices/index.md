> [!WARNING]
> Author's Note. This is a work of fiction. It is meant to entertain, not instruct. It is not intended as a work of theology and, if it were, would fail utterly, as much of it would be _really bad_ theology. Again: it is meant to entertain, not instruct.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Author's Note. I have chosen to base this off of several other works of fiction, largely because mixing the ideas from Mrs. Rowling with those from these other works is amusing. At times these choices constrain other choices I as an author might have otherwise made differently. Some of the theology here-in is _really bad_ theology not because I _could not_ imagine better, but because I sourced it in. I cannot fix everything without destroying the crossover feel that I am aiming for.

> [!TIP]
> Author's Note. These appendices are written from the perspective of an in-world researcher. These in-world researchers are off stage both in the that they do not appear in the story itself, but also in the sense that they are not necessarily from the _present_ as the characters in the story would perceive time. Not all of these researchers have written in the same style, nor have all aimed at, or achieved, any uniform level of professional scholarly writing. Most of these researchers are religious figures working for various in-world Vatican departments or commissions.
