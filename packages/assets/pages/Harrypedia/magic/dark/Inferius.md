An inferius (plural: inferi) is a reanimated corpse via a curse on said corpse.[^250508-1]  It is subtly different from the zombies of Vodou and African tradition, primarily in that there is an implication that, at least in this (ficitonal) universe, zombies are made from living people turned into corpses, while inferi are made from the bodies of those already dead.[^250508-2]
