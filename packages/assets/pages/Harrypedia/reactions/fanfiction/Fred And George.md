## The inter-twin relationship
I have been re-reading _[The First Day]_ by [little0bird], and overall it *is* a very well done work.  In fact, it may be precisely *because* it it is otherwise very well done that I am reacting to the way that [little0bird] depicts [George], and, through doing so, [Fred].  They are neither of them easy characters for a fan fiction author.  In part because there are *strong* stereotypes of them persisting across dozens of works out there.  In part because they get surprisingly little 'screen time' in the canonical works.

There is one pattern though, of which _[The First Day]_ is a prime example. You see primarily see this in stories placed after the war, and it may be an attempt to depict [George]'s reaction to loss.  If so, it does not work, and really irks me.  I get that the loss of his twin was an absolutely shattering experience for [George], one so great, so tragic, and so all-encompassing that it would be dauntingly difficult to attempt to portray with any justice.  I suspect that [George] himself, in the days and months following that loss, would not be a fair judge of the dynamic the two of them had before, when they were together.  As I noted, [little0bird] may be trying to depict some of that in _[The First Day]_, but if so, it does not successfully come across that way.  Instead, what comes across is something else entirely.  Listening to the depictions of [Fred] and [George] across the work, you come up with the following:

* [Fred] was the instigation for many of the pranks that others consider cruel.  [George] on his own would not have done them, but did not feel empowered to stop [Fred].  More than that, [George] felt obligated by their twin-ness (I know that is not a word, but it works here) to support his twin in these pranks that he ([George]) felt were going too far.
* [Fred], despite this seeming lack of empathy, was better with people, and was the person responsible for deciding when and whom to hire for the shop.
* [Fred] dated, [George] did not really.  Note that in the canonical world, [George] will go on to marry [Fred]'s ex-girlfriend.
* Speaking of the shop, it was all [Fred]'s idea. [George] just sort of went along for the ride.
* [Fred] came up with most of the ideas for the shop.
* [Fred] was responsible for making most of the ideas work, and into products that could be sold.

In short, [George] was a spectator in his own life, an extension of [Fred]'s over-sized personality.  At least in some works, like _[The First Day]_ this goes beyond just the idea of [George] eulogising [Fred] and a case of hyperbole, it *really feels like* [George] lacked any significant degree of gumption.

This is a problem. I am not saying that it is impossible that one of the two *was* in fact more out going and *did* in fact take more of the lead, but in the little we do see of them, they very much appear to be *partners*.  I think there *are* differences between them that Mrs. Rowling more hints at than fleshes out, but that by and large they were *both* fully engaged with life, both larger than life in some ways, and both contributed meaningfully to the success of their mutual endeavours.
