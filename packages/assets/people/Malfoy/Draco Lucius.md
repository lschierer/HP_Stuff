### Analysis

Draco is a coward, a bully, and a very conflicted young man. Over the course of
the last two books, he is essentially forced to face the fact that a world under
the rule of a "Dark Lord" is not the utopia that he has been raised to believe
it would be. This is not to say that he wakes up and actually reforms though,
nothing about Draco is ever that simple.

To understand where Draco ends up, you have to contrast the last two times, not
counting the epilogue, that we see him.

- In Chapter 23 of _[the Deathly Hallows][HPDH]_ we see this picture of Draco:

  > “I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his distance from
  > Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking
  > at him.[^211025-2]

  The passage continues, and Draco refuses to definitively identify either
  [Ron][] or [Hermione][], even though neither of them are in any way
  disguised, and his parents have already tentatively done so.

- In Chapter 31, we see a somewhat more assertive version of Draco.

  > He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away,
  > when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”
  >
  > He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing
  > behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the
  > small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.[^211025-3]

  Here Draco _does_ act as a restraining influence on [Crabbe][] and [Goyle][],
  but they would not have been there at all if not for him. _He_ is the
  instigating force behind this act, looking for revenge for the slight of
  having his wand taken from him.

Why is Draco so hesitant in the first case, and so much more assertive in the
second? Is it _really_ just that he is upset about the personal "insult" of
losing his wand? If so, there is no true turning away from the violence and
torture his family has embraced, for surely he _must_ know that the situation has
not changed for the target ([Harry][]).

In the first scene, Draco's family is oppressed, his father is struggling for
control with his aunt, and both (his father and aunt) in fear of [Riddle][]'s
disfavour. In the second scene, Draco has a clear shot at _personally_ winning
that same favour. The path to victory seems clear, and his self confidence is
back.
