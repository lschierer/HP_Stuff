This is probably the most troublesome thing that Ginny says in the entire
series. It is also the biggest counter example to trying to deal with the next
quote. The only interesting thing is that while Ginny uses the name "Loony"
outside the compartment, she switches to "[Luna][]" as soon as they go in, and
immediately strikes up a friendly conversation with the outcast girl. This is
not in character for someone who uses derogatory names. The contradiction in
Ginny's behaviour is unexplained, to my knowledge, by cannon sources.

When reading this keep in mind that this is filtered through [Hermione][].
While it looks fairly harsh, PercabethHinny noted in _Discovering the Truth_
that [Hermione][] _might_ be misrepresenting Ginny's actual words (emphasis
mine).[^20210513-2]
