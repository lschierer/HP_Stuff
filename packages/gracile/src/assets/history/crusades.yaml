    blurb: The Third Crusade starts
    description: |
      Precise dating of the Crusades defies my ability
        * the force was multi-national and started at different times
        * the crusades were marred by and interwoven with the jealosies, 
          corruption, and politics of the times in which they occur.  Is a
          particular action *part of the crusade* or part of the secular politics of the era?  Did even the particpants (were they even honest with themselves) know the answer to this question?
