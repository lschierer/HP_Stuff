I talk about this [some][CaHS] in relation to [Hogwarts], but the size of the school is really only a symptom, not the full problem in all of its details. The size of the population effects everything from the ability of the resulting culture to support sports teams, to more mundane stores like clothing stores and book stores, to what constitutes a reasonable government. The small population suggested by the small school size we see with a few hundred students attending across all seven years is barely a small town. This would not justify a full parliament, a multi-tiered court system, or anything more complex than a town council of perhaps a dozen people. There would certainly be no lords and ladies of noble houses, they would comprise a ridiculously high percentage of the population.[^240319-5]

On the other hand, it is possible that what we see here is the result of a series of rather radical population drops. [WolfgangNH] explains how this might as part of the backstory for his work exploring [magical marriage laws], _[The Ancient Proliferation Covenent]_.

His Death Eaters eliminated many Muggleborn and lesser-known half-blood houses, or the changes to our laws in the seventies chased many away. More than three thousand fled the country, and those families that only had older members have either died of natural causes or left as well, bringing us to our current situation," Unspeakable number three replied.

Here, the story is taking place after many who supported [Riddle] fall dead the moment he does. Cannon does not support the Dark Mark working that way, despite it being a popular idea. Still, the idea might be close enough. We know that [Riddle] and his supporters went on quite the killing spree as part of his first rise to power. I have not read the three movie scripts to know what has been written of [Grindelwald]'s rise to power and how many _in Britain_ might have died as a result, and even so, [I am not sure how canonical they should be considered](/Harrypedia). The numbers from this fan fiction might thus be sufficiently suggestive, we only know of a few dozen marked Death Eaters anyway.

If they are, even before the deaths in book seven, we are already dealing with a badly shattered fragment of a society. It becomes much easier to understand how that few dozen of terrorists can pacify a population, and compel obedience. _Everyone_ surviving is related to _entire families_ that **_no longer exist_** due to the atrocities committed by pure-blood fanatics, and in many cases by _these_ fanatics. This is true not simply because they are unbelievably inbred, but because the _that many died._ No wonder this shell shocked remainder cannot handle the idea of [Riddle]'s return.

Of course, I cannot be sure that this is what happened. It makes it hard to give them full benefit of the doubt as I analyse what goes on across the books.
