While [Ginny] has flaws, I remain partial to this pairing. Unfortunately fan
fiction rarely does it justice.

        Comments: In many ways this is a shorter version of _[Realizations]_.
        The Weasleys think of [Ginny] as a little girl, therefore she cannot be
        in a serious relationship, therefore she isn't in one. [Harry] broke up
        with her, therefore he isn't interested in her, so why would they be
        together?  These two statements sum up all the energy that is left when
        you are lost in grief.  The downside to this shorter version is that [Ginny] does a ton of lying and then blames her family for not realizing she is lying.

        Comments: also unfortunately unfinished, this story is another great
        example of [Harry] and [Ginny]'s mutually supporting relationship.
        This one is AU in that they get together sooner, and Umbridge is able to
        expel them.  This also show cases [Dumbledore]'s distrust of [Harry]
        and [Molly] as overprotective.

        Comments: Yet another work by this author, this one has the premise that
        [Hermione] does not actually get along with [Ginny], and that
        [Percy] is not any more happy with his family's association with
        [Harry] after the war than he was during it.

        Comment: Few stories deal with the possibility that [Harry] might get
        permanently hurt in the final confrontation with [Riddle].  This
        story does.

        Comment: This one is slightly more optimistic about the ability to use
        magic to help [Harry] recover.  Memories are used as a form of therapy
        to assist in recovery from catastrophic brain injury.

        Comment: This is an [X-Men] crossover story, and while
        I do not think the author *quite* pulled off the bit about despair as a
        trigger for mutant powers, it remains a story I keep coming back to.

        Comments: This short and entirely alternate universe work is amusing.
        [Harry] has magicked himself *out of his body* and [Ginny] decides to
        take him in for no real reason?  Totally doesn't make much sense, but
        highly amusing.

        Comments: I have always wished this were the first of a series.  In this, [James] and [Lily] are able, despite being dead, to induce a dream of what *might be* in [Harry], said dream being the six books covering years two through seven.  The alternate universe kicks in because in this story, trauma causes magical children to mature faster in odd ways.

        Comments: I think what I like about this one is that I can see where it
        comes from.  I sincerely believe that [Ron] and his brothers *would*
        have reacted poorly to the idea of [Harry] and [Ginny] dating if
        [Harry] had not utterly surprised them with his show of affecting for
        her after the quidditch match in book six.  I believe the intervention is entirely realistic, as is [Harry]'s response to it.

        Comments: I do not often like either redeemed [Snape] nor books with
        Albus Severus, and this book and its sequel contain both.  Despite that,
        I do enjoy it.  This book has one plot element that I particularly like,
        [Harry] crafts runes that amplify the power of the sacrifice he makes when he allows [Riddle] to kill him.

        Comments: I am a bit conflicted on this one.  On one hand, I like the
        stronger [Harry]/[Ginny] interaction.  The amulet induced bond is an
        interesting idea as well.  On the other hand, the premise of the story
        is to minimally extend canon to allow for the stronger relationship.
        In many ways I feel that it fails at that.  I dislike what it did with
        [Hermione], feel that [Ron]'s discovery of the relationship could
        have been done better, and *really* dislike much of the early [Luna]
        arc.

        Comments: As I mentioned on the page of stories [featuring Hermione],
        the concept of body swapping seems to fit naturally into the magical system of the books.  This is a brief look at how poorly teens would handle it.

        Comments: This is a sweet story that highlights the way that Mrs. Rowling missed the boat in understanding the role love plays in motivating people.  It is a bit spoiled by the harsh note of the killing curse in the last line, but if you ignore the self-hatred implied there, it is excellent.

        Comments: I have mixed feelings about this series, and it *is* a series and not a single work published in parts and recollected into one using the series mechanism.  The works vary in size from tiny snippets to full scale novels and *everything* in between, though most are short stories.  I rather strongly dislike Mrs. Rowling's final epilogue, as I think it misunderstands the true nature of forgiveness and indeed *goodness.*  Thus I have issues with Albus Severus as a character.  The other big issue is that the long series of very short stories eventually bogs me down.  There are, however, a few real gems in the collection.

        Comment: [Ginny]'s missed birthday irks me.  It might just be the
        third person limited narration, but it fits a pattern I dislike.
        These stories are not necessarily notable in themselves, and I
        do not want a full category page for them, but I want to call out
        that I am not the first or only person to note this problem.
