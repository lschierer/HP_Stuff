Sally-Anne is the character that disappears between the sorting in book 1 and the

literally nothing about her except her name, she is the perfect blank slate for
a fan fiction author.

    <dd>Comments: The idea of a magical tatoo that indicates soul mates is a
        reasonably popular trope in fan fiction.  This story combines that with
        the Harry leaves Britain theme.</dd>
