## Definition, Scope, and Limitations

As has been stated in other works on the nephilim, with rare exceptions all modern nephilim have a widely mixed heritage that includes powers that we believe to be derived from fallen angels that can be classified as belonging to the order of Thrones.   This inheritance makes these nephilim subject to what we call, for lack of a better term, "contract magic."  Despite this naming, it is imperative that one not let the word "contract" limit or misdirect one's thinking.  This is in fact a fairly large body of magic that pervades nephilim social life in a variety of ways. For example, the so called Unbreakable Vow is not _really_ a contract, but clearly falls in this category. These are contracts in the sense that at least one party agrees

- to do something
- to _not_ do something
- to be something

for, or with the other party, possibly, but not necessarily, in exchange for something.

**A magical contract can thus be an unilateral, bilateral _or_ multilateral exchange of goods, actions, _and/or_ persons.**

For obvious reasons it is difficult, even with the cooperation of one or more of the nephilim, to perform any real testing in a controlled way on the bounds of contract magic.  Any such testing would quickly cross the lines of what could be ethically considered permissible, as ample observational data exists to demonstrate that these contracts can be subtle in their implications, brutal in their self-enforcement, and thus the risk to the test subjects would be very very real.  This document then is largely the result of the Church's collected observations on the ways in which the nephilim have used this magic, the ways they have *attempted* to do so and failed, and what we know of the situations that distinguish each case. The theories advanced here are those that fit *all* known observational data, every effort has been made to exclude any theory for which there is *any* contradictory evidence, no matter how small or unlikely.  This is done to give the highest level of assurance to what we *can* put forth, even though the end result is that we know very limited amounts.  Far too frequently the theories advanced raise more questions than they answer.

All magical contracts are originated by one or more of the nephilim, their descendant races, or some combination thereof. The individual or individuals creating the contract are called the "originating participants." All magical contracts are created to effect some end. This end must be considered a net good by at least one of the originating participants, or the magic of the contract will fail. The end to be achieved must be possible, however it *may* require additional participants. If additional participants are required to achieve a proposed end, the additional participants are contractees. Originating participants cannot contract arbitrary persons as contractees, only those related to the originating participants in certain ways can be bound. All contractees must themselves also be of the nephilim or one of their descendant races.  Researchers speculate that these restrictions represent laws enforced by either direct Divine action or indirect action mediated via that angelic choir known as the Powers.

## Originating Participants and Contractees

When the set of Originating Participants represents either a distinct set from the set of Contractees, a subset of Contractees, or when the full set of Participants can only be represented as the union of the Originating Participants and the Contractees, there must exist one of a limited number of relationships between at least one Originating Participant and each Contractee.

That is, for each Contractee, an Originating Participant must be identifiable that meets the following conditions.

- No full human may act either
  - as Originating Participant including both,
    - directly acting on his/her own behalf
    - acting via delegated authority (see below)
  - as Contractee
- Any attempt by an Originating Participant to effect an end *known to be* contrary
  to natural law will fail.
  - This restriction does *not* apply retroactively. Situations have been observed where a Contractee has
    been bound by two or more contracts such that performing any one of them would, under the dictates of natural law, preclude the others. Careful consideration has in each such case demonstrated that each Contract was *possible* at the time of creation. The conflict arose only once one began execution.
  - The key phrasing in this restriction is "known to be." Several examples of immoral contracts have
    been identified where sufficient evidence exists that the Originating Participants had a deficit of understanding, and did in fact believe the contract to intend a good end. Researchers speculate that this restriction has been left intentionally weak because of its interaction with free will.  This may seem odd given that this magic is by its very nature *restricting* free will. We can only remind the reader that we have previously stated that these answers frequently raise more questions than they answer.
- Contractees may be related to Originating Participates with a parent -> child relationship, such that
  the Contractee is the child of the Originating Participant.
  - The inverse of the preceding rule does not work, and any such attempt will fail.
  - Contractees may not be related to Originating Participants with a sibling relationship.
- Contractees may be descended from the Originating Participant to the N^th degree, that is there may be
  any number of generations of parent->child relationships between the Originating Participant
  and the Contractee.
  - This is a super set of the first rule.
  - This allows only for strait lines. Uncles/Aunts cannot act as Originating Participant for a
    nephew/niece of any degree.
  - Many nephilim have adopted clan-line "houses." Despite this, the head of house/clan can act as
    Originating Participant only as *biologically* related, not based on this legal/social authority over the extended family. However, these contracts *may* work under the next rule.
- Authorised Originating Participants under the first two rules *may* delegate their authority so long
  as all of the following are true:
  - the delegation relationship is recognised by
    - the nephil delegating the authority
    - the nephil receiving the authority
    - the nephil who will be the Contractee
  - delegated authority is limited/scoped
    - the Delegated Originating Participant is *in fact* acting within the scoped limits
    - the Delegated Originating Participant *believes* him/herself to be acting within the scoped limits
    - the *Contractee* believes the Delegated Originating Participant to be acting within the scoped
      limits.
  - certain delegations are implicit:
    - these implicit delegations are scoped by natural law *and* societal law - **whichever is *more*
      restrictive on the Delegated Originating Participant**
    - parents to teachers
    - parents to governments

Delegated Originating Participant may be the most interesting of these. Many examples exist of these contracts behaving unexpectedly.

- A contract failed when for a good end, by a recognised teacher for a student. The student recognised
  the teacher as his teacher, however the law of the land restricted teachers such that they could act with delegated authority only during defined hours, and the contract was made outside those hours.
- A contract failed when for a good end, made by a government authority, for a person within the the
  borders of that country, however, the nephil proposed as contractee did not recognise the government as his own. The proposed contractee was a so called "muggle-born" and did not recognise the "magical government" as legitimate.
- The following *worked*: A contract for an objectively *bad* end, *thought* to be good by the government
  official acting as Delegated Originating Participant, for a Contractee who recognised her authority as a government official. The contract was within the scope of her authority as a government official.

Needless to say, these are only a minuscule subset of the numerous data points examined that, overtime, has lead to the above formulation of the delegated authority rule.

## Other Restrictions

Magical contracts need not be written on special paper, or even written at all, but they must be formalised agreements in some way. There are many ways to formalise an agreement.
Common ones include, but are not limited to:

- full legal signature on a paper (or parchment) contract
- formal statement of agreement using ritualised language with intent: "I, <name>, agree to xyz"
- repeated statements of agreement
  - using significant numbers (three, seven and ten are common)
  - in short duration's.
- acting as if bound to the contract (IE common law marriage) for either
  magically significant duration's or contractually significant
  events/actions that are distinctly related to contract and clearly not
  part of your non-contract/pre-contract normal life
  - marriages are consummated
  - the TriWizard champions processed out of the room
  - engagement rings
  - being sorted by the Sorting Hat
- As noted in the definition, contracts effect _something_. Person A agrees to do something *or be*
  something for Person B. The contract may or may not be one sided. The contract may or may not have penalties. However, a contract in which neither party is obligated to perform or not perform some action cannot bind.
- No contract may require a nephil to perform the marital act before the age
  of 14.[^230717-3] This would be a violation of natural law.
- 'Contract Magic' works *only* on nephilim. It does not work on pure humans.
  Remember that contract magic works by inducing your own magic to act against you.
  - the more powerful the nephil, the more powerfully he/she can be bound.
  - The *less* powerful the nephil, the less powerful any binding.
  - Contracts cannot require the use of a type of magic you do not have, either
    for their performance, *or in their penalties*.[^230717-4]
- Contracts cannot act as an [Imperius] curse or similar. That would come
  too close to a manipulation of the Will.[^230717-5]
  - Normally contracts operate through applying force.
    - Do something and you become ill, or even die immediately (the ritual of
      the Unbreakable Vow creates a contract which, if the contract is violated,
      results in the death of the violator).
    - Once contracted, and no matter your will, your body does not operate
      against the contract. This is a bit of a gray area - it is relatively
      easy for a nephil to contract something _not_ to happen. It is next to
      impossible to contract something _to_ happen. It will not absorb food, or
      your hand will not close (or your libido will not react).
  - There is some moral ambiguity here that the Church struggles with.
    - A contract signed by a proxy does not make the bound person morally
      culpable for the existence of the contract, the (sometimes incredibly strong) temptations it creates, or in some cases, even for the *situations* it creates.
    - A contract can trigger consequences that _pressure_ but do not _force_
      the nephil's Will.
    - The contract or contracts can create all sorts of conditions where the Contractee is making
      decisions with impaired freedom. They can even (and have been known to) create situations where the only known options are between formal participation with evil and immediate material participation with evil, neither of which are _actually_ acceptable.[^241126-1]

The key here is that Originating Participant (or their delegates) must _intend_ **to** contract, even if they do not fully understand the scope or significance of the penalties or terms.

[^230717-5]:
    per [Appendix G][AG], angels interfering to create these restrictions
    act with good intentions, but not always wisely. You might think 'contracts'
    already do too much. You might be right.

[^230717-3]: per [Appendix G][AG], many of the restrictions appear arbitrary.

[^230717-4]:
    per [Appendix G][AG], 'contract' magic was nearly useless until nephilim
    started to have widely mixed heritages.

## Effects

As noted above, magical contracts cannot force you to do something
the way the [Imperius] curse does. Rather, they force behaviour through the
existence of penalties. You can break an "Unbreakable Vow" but you die as a result. When
a secret keeper "contracts" to keep a secret, in a sense _everyone else_ is bound
not to know that something.[^241126-2]

[^241126-2]:
    This is why the Fidelius Charm is relatively unknown and uncommon. It is a combination of contract magic and area effect magic. One aspect of it protects the space from the perception from _everyone_ magical or not (area effect magic). Another aspect of it creates an _exception_ to the area effect magic for those who are parties to the contract. It can only protect a location that is in fact _secret_. Otherwise, one could share knowledge one obtained outside the contract without involving the contract. Thus a family hiding would need a new home, not a property historically associated with them or their family.

Contracts _can_ force you _feel_ things. Your emotions are just chemical
effects, a contract can make you unnaturally happy or sad, incite or
suppress physical attraction, make you hungry or nauseous, so on. A
contract can also cause a coma or prevent restful sleep, as these are also
physical reactions and do not (directly) involve the will. However, a
contract is not going to (for example) magically transport you like a port
key.[^230103-3]

## Implications

### Sin

In summary, a contract can, effectively, _coerce_, but not _force_ sin. But
in Catholic theology, the level of coercion a contract can easily induce is easily
more than sufficient to meet the bar for impairing free will. Thus a contract can
cause _serious_, but not _mortal_ sin. That being said, the Church has struggled
with this topic, some of which is summarised in [Appendix G][AG].

### Marriage Contracts

A nephil entered into a marriage contract could be coerced to be
faithful by magically suppressing his/her physical reactions to anyone
except the intended spouse. This would not force you to actually go
through with the marriage, but would provide a strong incentive to do so.
A stronger contract might make you physically ill or even die if you failed
to go through with the marriage.

This becomes problematic when a nephil finds himself/herself bound to multiple different marriage
contracts each of which requires that the contractee live and act on the marriage.  With penalties that can and frequently do include death for non-compliance, and contracts written in ways that do *not* include the monogamy proper to a true marriage, but rather allow for the pagan concept of multiple spouses, the contractee frequently experiences severe temptation.  Careful and prudential judgement is needed to determine if, in any individual case, any of the nephilim in these relationships are operating under sufficient duress due to the contracts as to impair their free choice.  Part of this prudential judgement must include the reality that one or more of the participants may be poorly catechised or even entirely uncatecised as regards to a true and proper understanding of marriage. They may have approached the Church having grown in this understanding only after having been in relationship for some time, or because some subset of the participants is more catechised than other participants and desires guidance. Each situation will present unique challenges and careful consideration will need to be made of the particular participants, the precise contract(s) involved, and the pressures on them.

### The TriWizard Contract and the Goblet of Fire

Historically three of the biggest European schools of magic have used an artefact they name "the Goblet of Fire" to conduct a magical lottery of student volunteers who are entered into a contract by virtue of winning this lottery.  The nephilim strongly believe that this contract involves, if violated, the loss of magic.  They are inaccurate, the actual *loss* of *being nephil* is not a possible consequence of a contract.  What it can do is prevent a Contractee who violates its terms from _using_ their magic, or rather, cause their own magic to bind itself that way. The nature of the selection, built into the Goblet, ensures that the Contractee has the necessary magic, inherited from the Thrones, to be able to self-bind this way. Those without sufficient magic of this type are ineligible for selection. It is worth noting that the nephilim community has an inaccurate understanding of precisely how magic works, and thus how strength in magic is evaluated _by_ magic, this is a large part of why the selections made by the Goblet are such a mystery to them.

### Debt

This is the other very interesting situation that leads to all sorts of
weird societal issues. Alice accepts, in some formal way, that she owes
Bob. This can be thought of in one of two ways, either of which _can_ lead
to a magical contract. Alice has agreed _to be_ in a state of debt until x
occurs or alternately, Alice has agreed to pay Bob back. The first is a
contract to be something, the second a contract to do something. If the
debt _can be paid_, well and good. Alice pays her debt, and is free of the
contract.

However, what if the debt cannot be paid? If Alice owes her life, or the
life of her child (in extreme but still realistic cases)? Or in less
extreme cases, what if she simply owes more money than she can earn while
keeping herself alive?

Because these are unstated contracts, if they form at all, they form
_because of_ expectations that the nephil themselves have formed over the
centuries. Some of these date back to times and places like the Roman
Empire where debt slavery was a common legal practice. While the laws of
the societies that the nephil live in have changed, the nephil have come to
expect that magic can and does create these contracts for these situations.
The terms of these contracts then are set unconsciously by the principles,
in accord with these norms passed down as part of the body of folk lore,
legend, history, and myth that they are raised with.

This kind of contract thus operates somewhat differently from other formal
contracts that a nephil might carelessly or unwittingly enter into.
In this modern era, someone outside the nephilim society, one of the
so-called "muggle-born", raised with no thought of slavery, would be
incapable of unconsciously binding himself/herself into slavery by accepting a
debt. One of the so-called "pure-blood" nephilim however, whose family
lore is filled with stories of using debts in precisely this manner, is
actually himself at greater risk of being so bound.

Occasionally one comes across a family of so-called "blood traitors" - nephilim whose genetic heritage is such that one would *expect* them to be raised steeped in and adhering to the lore,
mythology, and traditions common to the nephilim society of their geographic
locality, but who act more like the "muggle-born" in most practical ways. A
family like this would fall somewhere in the middle.  They are (at least
peripherally) *aware of* the traditions they reject, and more, probably
even aware that this magic *does in fact work*, but not predisposed to think
in those terms. The fact that it is an outside their common patterns of thought
gives them some level of protection from being bound while their knowledge that
they can be bound raises their susceptibility to it.

Lastly, children, because they are more absolute in their thinking, more
accepting of the idea that anything is possible, are more easily bound this
way than adults. Thus nephil societies almost universally have a tendency
to isolate their children from all but the most trusted of friends and
relations. A nephil child aware of his/her heritage will frequently grow
up knowing only his/her own extended family and one or two other families
until it is time to enter an apprenticeship, join a magical secondary
school (such as Hogwarts), or (if home schooled) join the workforce as an
adult.  This is because the nephilim have learned, through bitter experience,
that children will do all sorts of foolish and unfortunately irreversible things
if not carefully protected.

### Spontaneous Magical Marriage

Note this does not always lead to slavery. It can also lead to what some
call Spontaneous Magical Marriage (SMM), a form of marriage contract in
which both parties may or may not have any power imbalance at all, but
which old nephil families have learned, generally the hard way, usually
caries particularly harsh penalties. One rather famous (in nephilim society)
example of in recent times comes from magical Britain.  A SSM event occurred
between then 13 year old Pollux Black and his cousin Irma Crabbe.[^230711-1]
These two families with their history of dark dealings rightly feared the
imaginations that the children might have had in creating penalties for their
ill-defined contract.  Neither family wanted to risk these possibilities.

This contract is famous in part due to the ages of the two contractees - both
13 at the time.  A close observer might object that in our rules above, we said
that a contract would fail if it required the marital act before the age of 14.
Interestingly, this contract did *not* fail.  Effectively, the children were
contractually betrothed until the second child's 14th birthday, they were not
*required* to act before this. However, under the then (and still) current laws in
magical Britain, there was (is) no legal distinction between a marriage
and a betrothal - thus from a *legal* perspective the children were married. This
fact probably actually contributed to the notoriety of the situation, as the
families insisted the marriage remained unconsummated, and thus that they *could*
break it but were holding back out of concern for the children's welfare.  While
there is no reason to doubt the veracity of either family, researchers have
expressed considerable doubt over whether or not any such attempt to break the
contract would in fact have worked.

The SSM contract differs from other marriage contracts in several ways that
make it a distinct category of event worth separate consideration.

* In an SSM, the contract terms are unknown to everyone, including the Originating Participants.
* The SSM is *always* created verbally, generally in the form of promises exchanged.
* The SSM always produces a detectable effect, that is there is always a societally recognised
  sign produced that the Participants are in fact now married.
  - Where the SSM happens in modern European society, this typically takes the form of wedding
    rings spontaneously appearing on the participants' fingers.  These rings resist being removed.
  - There are records of one or both families trying to suppress the signs associated with the SSM.
    There are no records of this ever working for more than a few hours. There seems to be a compulsion to return anything taken to the participants, to allow them to live together, and to otherwise
    act as married.
  - This is *not* universally true of normal contractual marriages, where examples exist of contracts
    that operated for years without anyone other than the participants being aware that a contract
    was in place.
