## Definition

First of all, the word "contract" is rather misleading. For example, the so called
Unbreakable Vow is not _really_ a contract, but clearly falls in this
category. These are contracts in the sense that at least one party agrees

- to do something
- to _not_ do something
- to be something

for, or with the other party, possibly, but not necessarily, in exchange for something.

**A magical contract can thus be an unilateral, bilateral _or_ multilateral exchange of goods, actions, _and/or_ persons.**

All magical contracts are originated by one or more of the nephilim, their decendant races, or some combination thereof. The individual or individuals creating the contract are called the "originating participatants." All magical contracts are created to effect some end. This end must be considered a net good by at least one of the originating particants, or the magic of the contrat will fail. The end to be achieved must be possible, however it _may_ require additional participants. If additional participants are required to achieve a proposed end, the additional participants are contractees. Originating participants cannot contract arbitrary persons as contractees, only those related to the originating participants in certain ways can be bound. Researchers speculate that these restrictions represent laws enforced by either direct Divine action or indirect action mediated via that angelic choir known as the Powers.

## Originating Participants and Contractees

When the set of Originating Participants represents either a distinct set from the set of Contractees, a subset of Contractees, or when the full set of Participants can only be represented as the union of the Originating Particpants and the Contractees, there must exist one of a limited number of relationships between at least one Originating Participant and each Contractee.

That is, for each Contractee, an Originating Participant must be identifiable that meets the following conditions.

- no full human may act
  - as Originating Participatant,
    - directly
    - via delegated authority (see below)
  - as Contractee
- Any attempt by an Originating Participatant to effect an end _known to be_ contrary to natural law will fail.
  - This restriction does _not_ apply retroactively. Situations have been observed where a Contractee has been bound by two or more contracts such that performing
    any one of them would, under the dictates of natural law, preclude the others. Careful consideration has in each such case demonstrated that each Contract was
    _possible_ at the time of creation. The conflict arose only once one began execution.
  - The key phrasing in this restriction is "known to be." Several examples of immoral contracts have been identified where sufficient evidence exists that the
    Originating Participatants had a deficit of understanding, and did in fact believe the contract to intend a good end. Researchers speculate that this
    restriction has been left intentionally weak because of its interaction with free will.
- Contractees may be related to Originating Participates with a parent -> child relationship, such that the Contractee is the child of the Originating Participant.
  - The inverse of the preceeding rule does not work, and any such attempt will fail.
  - Contractees may not be related to Originating Participants with a sibling relationship.
- Contractees may be decended from the Originating Participant to the N^th degree, that is there may be any number of generations of parent->child relationships between the Originating Participatant
  and the Contractee.
  - This is a super set of the first rule.
  - This allows only for strait lines. Uncles/Aunts cannot act as Originating Participatant for a nephew/niece of any degree.
  - Many nephilim have adopted clan-line "houses." Despite this, the head of house/clan can act as Originating Participatant only as _biologically_ related, not based on this
    legal/social authority over the extended family. However, these contracts _may_ work under the next rule.
- Authorized Originating Participatants under the first two rules _may_ delegate their authority so long as all of the following are true:
  - the delegation relationship is recongized by
    - the nephil delegating the authority
    - the nephil recieving the authority
    - the nephil who will be the Contractee
  - delegated authority is limited/scoped
    - the Delegated Originating Participatant is _in fact_ acting within the scoped limits
    - the Delegated Originating Participatant _believes_ him/herself to be acting within the scoped limits
    - the _Contractee_ believes the Delegated Originating Participatant to be acting within the scoped limits.
  - certain delegations are implicet:
    - these implicet delegations are scoped by natural law _and_ societal law - **whichever is _more_ restrictive on the Delegated Originating Participatant**
    - parents to teachers
    - parents to governments

Delegated Originating Participatant may be the most interesting of these. Many examples exist of these contracts behaving unexpectedly.

- A contract failed when for a good end, by a recognized teacher for a student. The student recognized the teacher as his teacher, however the law of the land restricted teachers such that they could act with delegated authority only during defined hours, and the contract was made outside those hours.
- A contract failed when for a good end, made by a government authority, for a person within the the borders of that country, however, the nephil proposed as contractee did not recognize the government as his own. The proposed contractee was a so called "muggle-born" and did not recognize the "magical government" as legitimate.
- The following _worked_: A contract for an objectively _bad_ end, _thought_ to be good by the government official acting as Delegated Originating Participatant, for a Contractee who recognized her
  authority as a governemnt official. The contract was within the scope of her authority as a government official.

## Other Restrictions

Magical contracts need not be written on special paper, or even written at all, but they must be formalised agreements in some way. There are many ways to formalise an agreement.
Common ones include, but are not limited to:

- full legal signature on a paper (or parchment) contract
- formal statement of agreement using ritualized launguage with intent: "I, <name>, agree to xyz"
- repeated statements of agreement
  - using significant numbers (three, seven and ten are common)
  - in short durations.
- acting as if bound to the contract (ie common law marriage) for either
  magically significant durations or contractually significant
  events/actions that are distinctly related to contract and clearly not
  part of your non-contract/pre-contract normal life
  - marriages are consummated
  - the TriWizard champions processed out of the room
  - engagement rings
  - being sorted by the Sorting Hat
- As noted in the definition, contracts do _something_. Person A agrees to do something or be something
  for Person B. The contract may or may not be one sided. The contract may or may not have penalties.
  However, a contract in which neither party is obligated to perform or not perform some action cannot bind.
- No contract may require a nephil to perform the marital act before the age
  of 14.[^230717-3] This would be a violation of natural law.
- 'Contract Magic' works _only_ on nephilim. It does not work on pure humans.
  Remember that contract magic works by inducing your own magic to act against you.
  - the more powerful the nephil, the more powerfully he/she can be bound.
  - The _less_ powerful the nephil, the less powerful any binding.
  - Contracts cannot require the use of a type of magic you do not have, either
    for their performance, _or in their penalties_.[^230717-4]
- Contracts cannot act as an [Imperius] curse or similar. That would come
  too close to a manipulation of the Will.[^230717-5]
  - Normally contracts operate through applying force.
    - Do something and you become ill, or even die immediately (the ritual of
      the Unbreakable Vow creates a contract which, if the contract is violated,
      results in the death of the violator).
    - Once contracted, and no matter your will, your body does not operate
      against the contract. This is a bit of a gray area - it is relatively
      easy for a nephil to contract something _not_ to happen. It is next to
      impossible to contract something _to_ happen. It will not absorb food, or
      your hand will not close (or your libido will not react).
  - There is some moral ambiguity here that the Church struggles with.
    - A contract signed by a proxy does not make the bound person morally
      culpable.
    - A contract can trigger consequences that _preasure_ but do not _force_
      the nephil's Will.
    - The contract or contracts can create all sorts of conditions where the Contractee is making decisions with impaired freedom. They can even (and have been
      known to) create situations where the only known options are between formal participation with evil and Immediate Material participation with evil,
      neither of which are _actually_ acceptable.[^241126-1]

The key here is that Originating Participatant (or their delegates) must _intend_ **to** contract, even if they do not fully understand the scope or significance of the penalties or terms.

[^230717-5]:
    per [Appendix G][AG], angels interfering to create these restrictions
    act with good intentions, but not always wisely. You might think 'contracts'
    already do too much. You might be right.

[^230717-3]: per [Appendix G][AG], many of the restrictions appear arbitrary.

[^230717-4]:
    per [Appendix G][AG], 'contract' magic was nearly useless until nephilim
    started to have widely mixed heritages.

## Effects

As noted above, magical contracts cannot force you to do something
the way the [Imperius] curse does. Rather, they force behaviour through the
existence of penalties. You can break an "Unbreakable Vow" but you die as a result. When
a secret keeper "contracts" to keep a secret, in a sense _everyone else_ is bound
not to know that something.[^241126-2]

[^241126-2]:
    This is why the Fidelius Charm is relatively unknown and uncommon. It is a combination of contract magic and area effect magic. One aspect of it protects the space from the perception from _everyone_ magical or not (area effect magic). Another aspect of it creates an _exception_ to the area effect magic for those who are parties to the contract. It can
    only protect a location that is in fact _secret_. Otherwise, one could share knowledge one obtained outside the contract without involving the contract. Thus [Lily] and [James] needed a new cottage, not a
    property historically associated with the [Potter family].

Contracts _can_ force you _feel_ things. Your emotions are just chemical
effects, a contract can make you unnaturally happy or sad, incite or
suppress physical attraction, make you hungry or nauseous, so on. A
contract can also cause a coma or prevent restful sleep, as these are also
physical reactions and do not (directly) involve the will. However, a
contract is not going to (for example) magically transport you like a port
key.[^230103-3]

## Implications

### Sin

In summary, a contract can, effectively, _coerce_, but not _force_ sin. But
in Catholic theology, the level of coercion a contract can easily induce is easily
more than sufficient to meet the bar for impairing free will. Thus a contract can
cause _serious_, but not _mortal_ sin. That being said, the Church has struggled
with this topic, some of which is summarised in [Appendix G][AG].

### Marriage Contracts

A nephil entered into a marriage contract could be coerced to be
faithful by magically suppressing his/her physical reactions to anyone
except the intended spouse. This would not force you to actually go
through with the marriage, but would provide a strong incentive to do so.
A stronger contract might make you physically ill or even die if you failed
to go through with the marriage.

### The TriWizard Contract and the Goblet of Fire

Similarly, the TriWizard contract could not have _actually_ taken a participant's magic away as the nephilim community popularly believes. What it can do is prevent a Contractee who violates its terms from _using_ their magic, or rather, cause their own magic to bind itself that way. The nature of the selection, built into the Goblet, ensures that the Contractee has the necessary magic, inherited from the Thrones, to be able to self-bind this way. Those without sufficient magic of this type are inelgible for selection. It is worth noting that the nephilim community has an inacurate understanding of precisely how magic works, and thus how strength in magic is evaluated _by_ magic, this is a large part of why the selections made by the Goblet are such a mystery to them.

### Debt

This is the other very interesting situation that leads to all sorts of
weird societal issues. Alice accepts, in some formal way, that she owes
Bob. This can be thought of in one of two ways, either of which _can_ lead
to a magical contract. Alice has agreed _to be_ in a state of debt until x
occurs or alternately, Alice has agreed to pay Bob back. The first is a
contract to be something, the second a contract to do something. If the
debt _can be paid_, well and good. Alice pays her debt, and is free of the
contract.

However, what if the debt cannot be paid? If Alice owes her life, or the
life of her child (in extreme but still realistic cases)? Or in less
extreme cases, what if she simply owes more money than she can earn while
keeping herself alive?

Because these are unstated contracts, if they form at all, they form
_because of_ expectations that the nephil themselves have formed over the
centuries. Some of these date back to times and places like the Roman
Empire where debt slavery was a common legal practice. While the laws of
the societies that the nephil live in have changed, the nephil have come to
expect that magic can and does create these contracts for these situations.
The terms of these contracts then are set unconsciously by the principles,
in accord with these norms passed down as part of the body of folk lore,
legend, history, and myth that they are raised with.

This kind of contract thus operates somewhat differently from other formal
contracts that a nephil might carelessly or unwittingly enter into.
Someone like Hermione, raised with no thought of slavery, would be
incapable of unconsciously binding herself into slavery by accepting a
debt. Someone like Draco, whose family lore is filled with stories of
using debts in precisely this manner, is actually himself at greater risk
of being so bound. A family like the Weasleys would fall somewhere in the
middle.

Lastly, children, because they are more absolute in their thinking, more
accepting of the idea that anything is possible, are more easily bound this
way than adults. Thus nephil societies almost universally have a tendency
to isolate their children from all but the most trusted of friends and
relations. A nephil child aware of his/her heritage will frequently grow
up knowing only his/her own extended family and one or two other families
until it is time to enter an apprenticeship, join a magical secondary
school (such as Hogwarts), or (if home schooled) join the workforce as an
adult.

Note this does not always lead to slavery. It can also lead to what some
call Spontaneous Magical Marriage (SMM), a form of marriage contract in
which both parties may or may not have any power imbalance at all, but
which old nephil families have learned, generally the hard way, usually
caries particularly harsh penalties. It is because of such a SMM event
that the Black family allowed the marriage of Pollux Black to Irma
Crabbe at 13 years old.[^230711-1] These two families with their
history of dark dealings neither one wanted to risk the penalties that the
children may have made themselves liable to.
