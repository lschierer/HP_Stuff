The following represent estimates by researchers of the power levels of key figures in this historical chronicle.[^241125-10]

    Author's note:
    Per the inheritance rules, you can follow a different rule for inheritance in
    each column. As an author this maximises my flexibility in one sense. As a
    world builder, it comes closer to how real inheritance works. As a
    documentation producer, it is nightmarish, because it makes understanding where
    each character came from really complicated. Note, while I find it useful to
    chart this out, **there is no in-world test that would reveal these numbers.**

## Relative power of different characters in each class of power.

## Specific notes

### Abbott

#### Hannah

Hannah is a fairly average Hogwarts' student, her strong gift from the Powers will
not make her particularly stand out in any single branch of magic studied there.
She has the scores to get into NEWT level classes, but it probably will not be easy
for her once there.

> **Note**
> These scores correspond with someone who, in the cannon universe, has a panic attack
> going into her OWL exams. She, unlike the more central characters, truly had to work
> _really hard_ to get through those and into NEWT classes.

### Bones

#### Susan

Susan represents a slightly stronger average student. Her scores are slightly shifted
towards offence and defense, as befitting someone who comes from a family that [Riddle]
felt the need to attack personally. However, with an average of 6.77, she does not have
the history-making scores that characters like [Dumbledore] or [Harry] do.

[Riddle]: /Harrypedia/people/riddle/tom_marvolo/
[Dumbledore]: /Harrypedia/people/dumbledore/albus_percival_wulfric_brian/
[Harry]: /Harrypedia/people/Potter/Harry_James/

### Delacour

#### Fleur

As you can see, Fluer is fairly strong, so it was no surprise that the Goblet
chose her. Several of her scores are qualified in that her ability to use them
is limited by her veela nature. Unfortunately for her, the Goblet was not
designed to consider that.

### Dumbledore

#### Albus

The canonical books talk about Dumbledore as the most powerful wizard known,
the only one Riddle fears, and yet Dumbledore cannot defeat Riddle. Why is
this? Here I provide a possible explanation that is not simply lack of will to
do so. The devil is in the details. Riddle is exceptionally strong in both
offensive and defensive magic (Archangels and Angels), Dumbledore is only above
average offensively, but is superlative in transmutation, and the manipulation
of physics and chemistry, he is also hard to beat at binding the will and
augmenting nature. Unfortunately, Riddle actually equals or exceeds Dumbledore
in the wand arts _except_ in transmutation and temporary augmentation
(Virtues). Neither of these makes for an easy combat victory, and Riddle's
strong offensive magic means that it essentially becomes a stand-off between
the two. Dumbledore's great intelligence lets him use transmutation and
out-of-the-box thinking to make up for a lack of directly offensive capability.

### Dursley

#### Dudley

Dudley is a male child from a human father and a squibbish nephil mother. He
stood a good chance of being born pure human. He has a _minuscule_ ability to perceive that
magic exists, and essentially one totally uncontrolled ability from the
Seraphim: Dudley is incredibly sensitive to the use of legilimency, he is
practically an antenna for it. Since Harry is nearly always using legilimency
(to detect people around him if nothing else), Dudley is _constantly_ reminded
of Harry's presence magically. Since being reminded of Harry breaks the spell,
Dudley is effectively a bubble in which Harry is detectable. This bubble
extends to anyone that _Dudley_ is paying attention to. Dudley (unfortunately
for Harry) rarely pays any attention to teachers.

> **Note**
> Unfortunately, I need Dudley to do a fair amount of "Harry Hunting." He falls in that that 4% chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother.

### Evans

#### Lily

Lily inherited the sum total of her parents, plus an unexpected something
extra.

### Granger

#### Hermione

Hermione has very classic scores for the child of two squibs in the Seraphim,
Thrones, and Principalities categories. Her scores in the Cherubim,
Archangels, and Angels categories suggest her parents may not in fact _be_
squibs however. With these scores, my guess is that they are themselves the
children of squibs, but did not get the required scores to get noticed by the
magical world. The key thing about Hermione though is the Dominions, Virtues,
and Powers categories. These three scores all suggest that Hermione benefited
from that 1% base rate of something bizarre happening.

### Potter

#### Euphemia

We have no canonical background information on Euphemia except for the fact
that she was either a pure-blood or a half-blood. Thus, I have moulded her to
fit what I envision James to be. She is an incredibly eclectic mix of highs
and lows, in terms of ability.

#### Fleamont

Fleamont was an incredible duellist and a good potioneer.

#### Harry

Harry is, as you can see, slightly above an average of his parents except in a
couple of key categories where he straight up inherited the more powerful
ability. As the child of two exceptionally powerful parents, even a partial
inheritance can still result in someone really really powerful. These
represent Harry's numbers at birth.

#### James

James really should not have existed at all. He was born, per cannon, after
his parents were already old. In some places he he inherited the average of
both parents, in others he inherited the sum total of both parents, and in a
few places he has the stronger power.

### Prewett

#### Molly

Molly was born with a higher score for Thrones. Her own behaviour cost her
ability. I suspect that Molly learned this from her own mother, and thus that
while her score _was_ higher at birth, it was not _much_ higher, because she
inherited a disability due to her (maternal) ancestor's misbehaviour along the
same lines (love potions). If not for that abnormally low score, her average
would be one of the highest in the family.

### Prince

#### Eileen

We have next to no canonical information about Eileen Prince. We know that she
was either unable or unwilling to protect her sun from the muggle Tobias Snape.
I am assuming unable. With that in mind, I have given her a range of abilities
that left her week in the wand-based subjects, particularly where it comes to
the types of magic that would allow her to protect her son most effectively.
She was probably good but not brilliant at Potions.

### Riddle

#### Tom

Riddle, as the male child of a near Squib, did not have great odds of being a
powerful wizard. That he is means that he was that 1% chance. These also
represent numbers from at birth. Giving numbers from 1981 or later would, I
think, be too much of a spoiler.

### Snape

#### Severus

Snape is a potions prodigy. He does his potions entirely instinctively, _and
as such has no understanding of why other people do not find them just as
easy_. Snape is not just picking his ingredients precisely right, and
augmenting them exactly as needed, he is even manipulating chemistry at an
instinctual unconscious level so that his cauldrons and fires are exactly what
the potion needs. Snape has never needed an explanation of how to cut an
ingredient, how to stir a potion, _why_ one stirs one way versus another way,
or any of the other myriad details of potion making. He does not understand
why anyone else might need these tedious lectures - they are self explanatory
to anyone with half a brain. The only reason why Lily outshines him in
Slughorn's class is because:

1.  he is essentially lazy. The class comes easily to him, so he frequently
    tries just hard enough to show up everyone present _except_ Lily (he does
    not care if she beats him)
1.  he is distracted by James and Sirius
    - partly by what they are doing to him
    - partly by what he is trying to do to them
1.  he is distracted _by **Lily**_ whereas she feels only friendship for him and
    so is not distracted by him.

> **Note**
> While Snape does love potions, his true love is the Dark Arts. There is a reason why,
> in the cannon universe, Harry will find all sorts of self-crafted spells in the margins
> of Snape's _potions_ text book. Snape was not focused on _potions_ in _Potions_ class,
> he was busy crafting his own spells, many of which were dark in nature.
> The **_true_** potions afficianado would have been fully focused on his/her work, not
> on something else.

### Weasley

#### Bill

If you look, Bill has pretty much the ceiling score of his brothers in most
categories, except virtues. He needs someone else to brew potions for him 9
times out of 10 (hence Fleur is the healer in the family). Bill is not taking
advantage of any real 1%s, he is simply getting nearly the best of two powerful
parents.

#### Charlie

Reading the magic in magical creatures is key to Charlie's work. He is
fortunate that he does not need to transfigure much, and reasonably (though not
stellar) scores in locality magic means that he can help with the protections
at the reserve.

#### Fred

I think Fred is slightly more perceptive than Ron. Fred and George understand
how magic works, though they do not realise they do so. Fred is able to figure
out potions but it takes a fair amount of trial and error to get the
application of his magic right as he creates them for the first time. He does
not have Ron's gift for locality based effects.

#### George

George is average at reading people (for a nephil). Slightly better at
transmutation, he is not quite as good at potions (as compared to Fred).

#### Percy

Percy studied so hard because he, unlike Ron, is determined _not_ to under
perform. The characters do _not_ know about these power levels, so Percy does
not know that he simply _isn't_ as capable as his older brothers.

#### Ginny

Ginny's brothers fear her temper for good reason. Ginny seventh child, and the
first girl in generations. There is an implication that the Weasley family may
have been cursed as part of a plot to isolate them by preventing them from
making alliances by marriage. If so, it stands to reason that as the curse
wears away, the child that breaks the curse might absorb some of the residual
energy and become correspondingly more powerful. However, due to the maternal
influence and despite her paternal influence, she is merely minimally
acceptable in the Thrones category, making her somewhat vulnerable to mental magics.

#### Ronald

Ron is an under-performer, he has the _ability_, but not the drive. That being said, Ron
_is_ under-powered as compared to his brothers. If he knew that, his
inferiority complex would be even worse than it is. Of particular note, like his siblings,
note the influence of [Molly](#Molly)'s low score from the Thrones.

> **Note**

## Author's Notes on Implications

If you compare Snape, James, and Lily, you will see that Snape and James are
almost precisely equal, except for their exact skill set, and that Lily is
actually _slightly_ under-powered compared to both of them. This matches what
Ollivander says of James' and Lily's wands, that James' has a little more power,
and yet makes Lily powerful enough to be scary.

The other thing I have done is that the average of Riddle and Harry's abilities
are both an 8, so that while they have different specific abilities, they are in
a sense equally strong nephilim. You will see that really Harry is a much
more balanced wizard, he has neither the highs nor the lows that Riddle has
(though neither is an especially strong Cherubim). The one place that Harry
shines that Riddle does not is the Principalities - population effects. This is
probably counter-intuitive. Riddle works by intimidation, and while you _can_
intimidate populations, that is not actually what he does. Instead he creates
atrocities, and allows his _actions_ to act on the populace. Remember that the
population effects from the Principalities are tied to locations, thus Harry is
unconsciously enhancing his environment with magics that affect the people
around him. However, he will not find out that is happening until he has
travelled far enough to see what it looks like when people are _not_ affected by
this magic.

If you stack rank Riddle against Lily and James, the there are really four things
that make Riddle so scary.

1. With an inheritance of 9 from the Seraphim, few people can defend against his
   legilimency, particularly when he employs it in mid duel.
1. With his maximised inheritance from the Thrones, nearly no-one can resist his
   Imperius Curse. In point of fact, Riddle is unconsciously bending other
   nephil to his will merely by being in their presence.
1. Few wizards (or witches) are as strong at _both_ attack and defence (this is
   effectively two things, hence I said four total).

If you compare him to Harry, and in light of the above, I am going to get
complaints that I am either being inconsistent if I let Harry resist Riddle's
Imperius Curse, or that I'm ignoring cannon where Harry does just that. There
are three possibilities, and I will probably actually go some combination of
them:

1. If you put the Goblet of Fire grave yard situation in this universe, then you
   would _not_ just have Harry resisting Riddle, because Harry also has Lily's
   protection augmenting his capabilities. Riddle never fully understood that
   protection, and taking Harry's blood does not fully bypass it.
1. Lily's protection aside, you need to decide what theory of
   [horcruxes][] you are using, and what affect that theory has on Riddle's
   powers after the destruction of the diary. For this work, I think that both
   the audience and the characters are in the dark about that answer, but
   suffice to say that one way or another, you cannot suffer the destruction of
   a [horcrux][] you have created without _suffering._
1. In the books, Harry _learns_ to resist the Imperius Curse, the fake Moody
   uses it several times on him before he can resist it easily. Even then, it
   takes Harry noticeable effort to resist Riddle's when they meet in the
   graveyard. This suggests that Harry's ability _is_ less than Riddle's, but
   that Harry's is sufficiently strong that _with training_ he can _learn_ to
   stand up to Riddle. This last suggests that anyone with a score of 8 in the
   Thrones can be taught to resist Riddle's Imperius Curse. That puts James,
   Dumbledore, and Snape at a level where they need not fear Riddle overwhelming
   them in the mind arts.
