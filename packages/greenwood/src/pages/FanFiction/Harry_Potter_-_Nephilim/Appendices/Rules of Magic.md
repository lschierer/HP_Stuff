## Overview

Church scholars have studied magic almost continuously since the Church came out of hiding following [the Edict of Milan][EoM]. In addition to what the clergy have observed and compiled directly themselves, the Church has archived visions that various saints have had that disclose additional information. As these visions, like all visions of the saints, are not considered binding on the faithful, the Church considers this information useful, but not necessarily definitive. Church scholars have, from this research, derived these rules for how magic works.

## Overall Rules

Experience with those who repent from witchcraft and other traffic with fallen spirits has aided the Church scholars in the classification of the magic the nephilim use, as their magic is inherited from those who have fallen into these snares. Thus we know that magic can be subdivided into nine aspects, each corresponding to one of the nine angelic choirs. Each choirs appears to grant a distinct ability to those who are corrupted by members of that choirs, these abilities being inherited by their children. Further, should either the corrupted themselves, or their children, go on to procreate with others from a different "lineage," the powers will frequently combine in the next generation. Thus most modern nephilim have powers that derive from most if not all nine choirs.

### Power Levels

Individual nephil can be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) for access to each class of [angelic abilities][abt].[^221216-2] These power levels are estimates, and no precise way exists to directly measure the precise ability of the nephilim. Despite this, scholars feel confident that these estimates provide useful and meaningful points of reference for the comparison of the abilities of any given nephilim.

<powerlevel-table></powerlevel-table>

This begs the question "What do you mean by expected?" Obviously there is no
standards body anywhere in the world that is grading students using these
categories. While the Church has not hidden its research from the nephilim, they have proven remarkably resistant to benefiting from the body of knowledge the Church has compiled, or incorporating it into their own knowledge base in any way. The nephilim have either forgotten or actively deny that they are descended from angels, and refuse to think of their abilities in terms of the angelic choirs.

Given there is no objective standard based on these categories, scholars are attempting to describe a hypothetical situation. Given adequate but not necessarily superlative instruction, someone who does not meet the goal described in a given power level is being lazy, suppressing their abilities, or both. They are neglecting their own strengths.

### abilities by type

Church scholars designate first generation nephilim the "primordial nephilim." By this we do not mean those from the prehistoric times, but rather, those that are immediate children of the humans that first transact with fallen spirits to gain power. These "primordial nephilim" are not different species, as they are cross fertile and in fact nearly all modern nephilim trace their origins to a wide variety of different primordial nephilim types. Rather, this is a nephil that is unique in that it is a single remarkably strong trait that can be independently inherited and traced through the generations. For categorising these traits, the Church has found that the Areopagite model[^220628-4] of angelic choirs produces the most accurate results, and will be used here.

For each choir we list both the description of that choir and the traits we observe in the nephilim descending from fallen angels of that type. While most are obvious derivations, there are a couple of cases where the trait observed in the resulting nephilim is only remotely related to the description of the angelic choir. This suggests that further research into the nature of angels, the nature of magic, or both, is required. The ability to perform such research is limited by the fact that the rate of new primordial nephilim is (thankfully) extraordinarily low, and that even when it does occur, the clergy are not always both able and sufficiently educated to collect meaningful data.

#### Seraphim

- These angels perceive God most directly, and know Him in and as Himself best.
- The resulting nephil does not appear to have any ability to perceive God.
- As man is a limited image of God, the nephil has the ability to perceive the
  heart of the man/nephil. When used on other nephil, this allows access to information about the person's physical state, their will, and their memories. When used on humans, it allows only access to information about the person's physical state. However, an astute judge of human nature can combine this with situational awareness, historical information about the person, body language, and similar data to make highly accurate guesses.

#### Cherubim

- These angels perceive God only indirectly, but understand that perception
  best. Their work is the contemplation of God through His works.
- The nephil inherits the the ability to perceive/detect what has been done
  with magic, and what is possible with it. This is a more passive ability
  than is inherited from any other choir, and could be confused with the
  mastery granted by inheriting a power level of 10 from the other choirs.
  The difference is that the Cherub's child really does not even need to be
  taught to the extent they inherit. You will find no class in any magical school about detecting "spell residue" or similar ideas, because you can either do this without training or you cannot.

#### Thrones

- The Thrones contemplate Judgement.
- While the Thrones, like the Seraphim, are primarily contemplative, the
  inheritance from them is, again like that from the Seraphim, much more
  active. The nephil has the ability to bind the will of other nephilim, and
  to defend against being so bound.
- This ability has marginal _at best_ effect on full humans. Despite this, the magical population
  continues to use spells intended to change behaviour on full humans as part of their attempts at preserving their so called "International Statute of Secrecy."
- Careful investigation with the aid of the rare cooperative nephil has shown that many of these behaviour
  altering spells have a secondary mode of operation that affects brain chemistry that _does_ work on full humans frequently in ways that mimic the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, alcohol, or both.
- There is at least some data indicating that these secondary modes of operation come from abilities in
  other categories automatically compensating for the failure of abilities in this category. However, scholars are unwilling to probe too deeply due to the danger to both the caster and the subject.
- Things like the imperious curse or the confundus charm fit in
  here.
- Magical contracts are very real,[^221119-1] and any clergy dealing with the nephilim should be wary of
  the ways in which a nephil can be affected by them.

#### Dominions

- These angels are responsible for ordering the work of all other angels.
  Their name implies actual, real authority.
- The relationship between the way Dominions operate and the abilities the
  nephilim gain is indirect, and one of several places that suggests flawed understanding.
- God creates by decree - He spoke and the world was made. The nephilim are
  not capable of true creation, but have authority only over the _form_, but not the substance, of the material world. They can thus by their magic transmute the form of one thing to another.
- This will be temporary unless the change is "locked" in place
  through combining this ability with that inherited from the Powers. No primordial nephilim with the power to transmute has ever been observed to do anything long lasting.
- No nephil has ever been observed to retroactively make a transmutation
  permanent, it must be done _as the change is made, by the same nephil_.

#### Virtues

- The Virtues are responsible for enforcing the laws of physics. Traditional
  sources tell us that they generally concern themselves primarily with
  massively macroscopic effects.
- As related to the magic of the nephilim, this a better understanding appears
  to be that actually _doing_ anything with the way physical laws work at a microscopic and sub-microscopic level would be either catastrophic, unduly influence free will for those affected by it, or both. As a result, the nephilim appear to be either inherently unable, or Divinely restricted from, doing anything at the microscopic level.
- Given the above limitation to the macroscopic, one _can_ understand the
  nephilim as temporarily augmenting the nature of the natural world.
- Things like animation charms fit here, but so do things like levitation
  charms.
- Interestingly, primordial nephilim and those who inherit from them appear to
  gain a passive ability as well. When they simply touch or handle certain raw materials (potions ingredients), these become "charged" with extra properties.
- Like the magic inherited from the Dominions, the magic inherited from the
  Virtues is highly temporary. It appears to require continuous concentration on the part of the nephilim.
- Nephilim communities with inheritance from a spectrum of choirs have devised
  several ways around the time limitations. See latter sections for details.

#### Powers

- Powers are the first of the overtly militant angelic orders (looking from
  top down). They protect the work of the Virtues from interference. This,
  to me, implies that God providentially foresaw that giving angels free will
  would entail a universe in which that free will was exercised in wrong
  ways.
- The nephil inherits the ability to affect time.
- When used directly on the natural world, this results in things like time
  turners on one hand, but also stasis charms on the other.
- Divination is _not_ included in this ability, that is something different.
- Nephilim who inherit this in addition to some other ability quickly learn
  that this ability combines with other powers.
  - When used on a magical effect, you can make it last longer (even permanently) or shorter (a finite incantatem charm for example totally cancels it).
  - The relationship to this and the parent angel's ability is indirect and
    suggests a need for more research.

#### Principalities

- The principalities are concerned with groups of people - nations, cities,
  clubs, ethnic groups. They are not concerned with the individual, but with
  the common good.
- The nephil inherits the ability to create area effects on populations and
  places (unplottable, "muggle repelling", so on).
- This differs from the Thrones in that the gifts from the Thrones affect
  individuals regardless of location.
  - A Thrones derived ability always affects a specific person regardless of
    where that person is.
  - A Principalities derived ability affects whoever happens to be in a
    specific location, regardless of who that person is.
- The nephilim appear to have some ability to target what _kind_ of who is
  affected. Scholars record spells successfully affecting:
  - Anyone below a certain age.
  - Anyone with a specific genetic trait.
  - Any _nephilim_ with a specific intent.
  - Anyone in a specific emotional state. Note the slight but key difference
    from the proceeding. Most nephilim communities do not appear to be reliably aware of this distinction.
- Like the magic of the Powers, these spells must be continuously powered,
  except where similar work arounds have been developed using other classes of abilities.

#### Archangels

- These angels are tasked with particular goals in particular times and
  places. Heal this person, protect that person, deliver this message. They
  accomplish concrete tasks on God's behalf, with whatever force is required
  to do so.
- The nephil's inheritance is again indirect.
- The Archangels exercise visible force, the nephil gains the ability to use
  magic to enforce his will on others via external means.
- This should not be confused with the Thrones or Principalities. The magic
  inherited from these choirs influence others _directly_. That magic is, for lack of better phrasing, "inside your head." The magic inherited from the Archangels is more like pushing someone, or pulling him/her into place.
- As implied above, Scholars have also observed some nephilim use spells that
  superficially appears identical to that inherited from the Principalities, in that it affects a location. However, the _mode_ of operation differs, again as noted above.
  - A primordial nephil from the Principalities would keep you out by making
    you want to be somewhere else.
  - A primordial nephil from the Archangels would physically stop you from
    going there.
  - The powers appear to combine in those who descend from both types
    particularly well.
- Some of these magics appear to trigger corrupting changes with at very high
  rates, to unusually severe degrees, or both.

#### Angels

- Also called Guardian Angels, these angels are tasked with the welfare of
  specific individuals in a general sense. They differ from the Archangel who
  has a particular goal to achieve in time and space in that the Guardian
  Angel is concerned with the _moral_ state of its assigned person. The
  Guardian Angel is concerned with salvation.
- The inheritance from the nephil is the ability to resist magical force, of
  any kind, from any other class of magic.
- Shield spells, spells to undo effects (which differs from stopping the
  duration very slightly but significantly), and healing spells.
- While this description sounds like it should be one of the safest categories
  of magic, corrupting change has been observed even primordial nephil of this type.
- Scholars have reasoned that defensive measure might still warp the mind/soul
  of the user; it might effectively be resisting too much, or the wrong way. For example in the physical world one can drown out a voice by being louder, by covering one's ears, or by puncturing one's ear drums. While the last is extreme, and only a crazy person would do it, remember that nephil do not always understand how their magic affects them.

[^221119-1]:
    As stated elsewhere in these Appendices, I believe the existence
    of magical contracts is actually _implied_ by the canonical Harry Potter
    books. However, I am not going to debate their canonicity here. For the
    purposes of this work, they exist.

## Mapping to how the Nephilim themselves understand Magic

Nearly all nephilim communities categorise magic as follows:

### charms

- generally a mix of inheritance from Virtues and Powers for the lower years,
  however things like "cheering charms" are _actually_ a form of transmutation
  manipulating the form of brain chemicals, and thus, temporarily, their
  effect.

- memory charms like obliviation are a mix of transmutation on brain
  chemicals with the Seraphic ability to perceive (and thus target the
  transmutation really precisely). Because they are chemical in nature, they
  can work on full humans. However, they can be more precisely targeted and
  more finely crafted/tuned when used against a nephil. Thus you can make a
  human forget, say, the last hour, or the last day; you can make a nephil
  forget that a single person was present while otherwise remembering the
  event.
- Imperious curse acts differently on humans and nephil. Using the
  imperious curse on a human will require "operating" that human like you
  would a puppet or a remote control robot, while using it on a nephil acts
  more like what you see in the Harry Potter books, where you can give a
  command and the victim's own mind will assist in finding ways to carry out
  the order.
- Confundus type charms only work well on nephil, because they extend memory
  charms by depending on abilities inherited from Thrones. When used on a
  human, this charm interferes with the ability to form a long term memory,
  and the ability to retrieve long term memories, both for the duration of
  the charm, and it causes the various chemicals in the brain to surge. So
  humans will tend to end up all sorts of confused, but without the fine
  grained control over what they are confused about, or what they think is
  actually happening that you can achieve with a nephil. Note that not all
  nephil are _aware_ of the difference in affect here.

### transfiguration

- comes primarily from the Dominions, but is highly temporary unless you use
  abilities from the Powers to extend (perhaps infinitely) the duration _as
  you make the change_.
- Nephilim scholars will teach students about Gramp's Law. Their understand is highly flawed. As a result of this flawed formulation, the "law" has exceptions, each of which also have exceptions, for example wine
  can be conjured.[^220718-1] These flaws stem from a few primary misconceptions:
  - transfiguration is temporary by default. Your transfigured food will
    revert. For something like water into wine, that is not actually a
    problem. You can drink your wine, enjoy it, and simply experience less of a hang-over the next day. For something like a sandwich, you would now have a block of wood (if you transfigured the sandwich out of wood) instead of something digestible.
  - Successful _permanent_ transfiguration means transmuting the actual
    substance all the way down to the subatomic level. Few of the nephilum
    know _anything_ to the level of detail required for this to be
    successful, and where they do, it tends to be fairly pure elements,
    like raw iron into raw gold. But even then, combining your
    transmutation with the Powers magic necessary to make it permanent is
    poorly understood, thus poorly taught, and so see the prior point.
  - Few if any nephilim understand the real differences between conjuration,
    vanishing, and transmutation. Most attempt to teach all three as if they are the same thing.

### Defence

- Much of the content in this class is, as a mix of content categorised (by the
  nephilim) elsewhere, particularly Charms, Runes, Transfiguration, and Care of Magical Creatures.[^241125-3]
- Some of it, particularly as it comes to the study of specific counter curses
  and shields, comes from the Angels.
- Some of it, where actual offensive spells are taught (such as the knockback
  jinx), comes from the Archangels.
- This class is a mishmash of content, part learning about "dark" creatures,
  part learning about the curses you are defending against (except not practising casting them), part learning about the counters to those curses, and part learning about avoiding the need to ever use those counter curses. Since many spells _can_ be used either offensively or defensively, but are not _inherently_ combat related, this class is pulling from all sorts of branches of magic.

[^241125-3]: I am mostly taking [Ishtar][]'s position from _[The Case of the Missing Wizard][TCMW1]_ but with a twist.

[TCMW1]: https://archiveofourown.org/works/4125717
[Ishtar]: https://archiveofourown.org/users/IshtarsDream/pseuds/IshtarsDream

### animagus

- No modern nephilim realises how integral to their very being the so called
  "animagus" transformation is.
- For European nephilim, there is a pervasive believe that this ability can
  only be accessed by a rare few through an absurdly difficult ritual that combines a ritual spell with aspects of transfiguration with a potion.
- The Uagadou[^220628-5] school teaches students ways to influence what animal
  you become. In fact, only those who inherit from the Thrones, the Powers, and the Dominions can succeed at the method they teach. This method uses the melded powers from all three inheritances to transmute the student's own nature to the desired animal (or animals), so that when they exercise the inherit animagus ability, they become an "unnatural" (to that individual) animal. Few ever realise how invasive this transmutation is to their sense
  of self.
- Other cultures have other ways of unlocking this ability, some of which are
  safer than others.
- The ability itself needs to be "unlocked" only because the nephilim have
  convinced themselves, subconsciously, that it needs to be. Mostly because they have a mental image of themselves as human (which they are not).

### conjuring

- requires inheritance from the Powers, as you are in essence manipulating
  quantum probabilities.
- No known nephilim community _actually_ understands how conjuring
  _actually_ works.
- The nephilim have manipulated time in a highly localised (nearly
  negligible) space until it becomes probable that quanta will appear in the
  desired configuration, and more, that this has _actually happened_ (and not
  some other quantum affect).
- Conjuration will tend to be permanent.
- The nephilim believe Gramp's Law again comes into play, but see the
  note above about needing to understand your target down to the elemental
  level for it to end up being digestible. A comfortable chair does not need
  to be so accurate, because we expect it to remain a chair. A sandwich we
  expect our bodies to _break down_ into the constituent molecules, which
  thus _have to be there_.

### Vanishing

- Though considered transfiguration, this is actually a really weird mix of
  abilities from Virtues and Powers.
- Like conjuring, no known nephilim community _correctly_ understands it.
- The nephilim are essentially making the thing vanished air soluble, then for
  the space that thing occupies, manipulating time such that it appears to have instantly dissolved.
- Because it is explained so poorly, students new to the practice will often
  actually attempt to modify the physical properties of the thing being vanished instead of its chemical properties, resulting in transparent versions instead of something that has, to paraphrase one well known nephil scholar, gone into everything.
- Vanishing is, highly problematic magic. When practised on a living thing, you are killing that thing. Fortunately, it is _impossible_ to vanish anything that has an immortal soul, the magic simply will not work.[^241125-4]

[^241125-4]: Church officials worried about this for centuries, and some scholars to this day refuse to accept the vision that revealed this titbit. Some continue to worry about murder-by-vanishment.

### Potions

- These are complicated. The magic comes in part from the brewer (primarily
  from the Virtues), and in part from the ingredients (different ingredients
  will react to the nephil's magical influence in different ways).
- No two nephil will affect ingredients precisely the same way; similarly no
  two instances of the same ingredient are actually precisely the same.
- A strong ability inherited from the Cherubim will make you more able to
  discern the effects of the ingredients, including between instances of supposedly identical ingredients.
- Thus the best potioneers strongly inherit from both the Cherubim and Virtues.
- Some potions additionally require chemical reactions not possible in nature.
  - This requires the potioneer to have abilities from the Powers to make a
    probabilistic reaction happen in the desired time frame.
  - Alternately, the potioneeer can transmute the form of one ingredient to
    make it chemically react the desired way.
- Lastly, if a potion is to be stored, rather than used immediately, the
  effects must be locked in place _at the time it is brewed_, again an ability coming from the Powers.
- Potions is a wandless art, though some traditions _do_ use incantations
  and/or wand movements as part of the process to assist the potioneer to trigger their magic.
- All European schools teach potions in its hardest form: both wandless and
  silent, requiring near instinctual use of effectively three to four forms of magic simultaneously.
  - The nephil must use abilities inherited from the Virtues to augment the
    ingredients with additional properties, locking the augmentation in place using the time magic from the Powers (endless duration).
  - As this highly personal process will result in something slightly different
    from nephil to nephil, he/she must use abilities from the Cherubim to pick precisely the ingredients affected by his/her magic to precisely the right degree and in precisely the right way.
  - Should the ingredients not want to mix, the nephil then uses abilities
    inherited from either the Dominions or the Virtues, either transmuting the form of the ingredient into something that can mix, or to manipulate the laws of chemistry to make the reaction possible.
  - The different ways and patterns of stirring are essentially mental triggers
    to help the nephil activate their magic.
  - **This means that a potion recipe is more of a suggestion than a true
    recipe**, the best will always come from deviating from the recipe by _just
    the right amount_ to account for your personal magic and the specific
    ingredients you happen to be using in this particular instance.

### Runes

- Runes were developed by the nephilim as an early way for individuals with
  different powers to share those powers and achieve effects that neither could alone.
- Runes are Runes are _authored_ from powers inherited from the Virtues, you
  augment reality to give your writing not just meaning, but power.
- They are, however, _powered_ by the inheritance from the Powers, (investing
  an element of long duration to the rune created).
- Thus two people equally skilled at creating runes might not be equally
  skilled at powering those runes, or vice versa.
- While developed to achieve affects neither could alone, Runes work far better
  when the scribe has both abilities.
- Nephilim later found that Runes can be authored to _absorb_ power from the
  surrounding area to power connected sequences of runes.
  - This was done by combining abilities from the Principalities, Virtues, and
    Powers. using abilities inherited from the Principalities, instead of being pre-charged via the Powers.
  - This has a side effect of reducing the effect of any attempt to use other
    magic in any way not connected to that rune sequence.
  - For a school (like Hogwarts in England), nephilim children would be safer
    when practising their magic because the effect of each spell would be lessened.
  - The hospital or clinic in the school would need to be shielded from most of
    the runes protecting the rest of the school to ensure that injuries could still be cured using magic at full efficacy.
  - Overall, this effect would bolster the idea that schools are one of the
    safest places in a given locality.
- The use of runes persists into the modern era in part because the effects
  created by these "primordial" nephilim are still encountered by the "modern" magical society, and in part because they remain an efficient and effective way of combining one's own inheritance from the Powers with Virtues, Dominions, Principalities, Angels, and/or Thrones. This is especially true when, as is almost universally the case, the nephil in question does not even understand these as the true way to classify magic.

### Divination

- This magic has two categories.
  - Prophesy rarely magic at all. True prophecy occurs when a nephil is
    possessed by a fallen angel, who communicates some (usually cryptic) message. If they ever tell anything truthful, it is only because they judge it useful to lead us further into sin. Thus most prophesies are misleading, false, or both (they also tend to be self fulfilling, like that in Macbeth.[^20210902-5])
  - Users particularly skilled in the abilities from the Seraphim may be able
    to use these abilities to make incredibly accurate predictions about
    people without crossing any lines. Knowing that someone is clumsy from
    their memories, knowing that someone is afraid from their emotions, the
    user can predict some short term events and reactions in ways that might
    seem like divination. Practices like palm reading, tea leaves, and
    crystal gazing grew from this magical insight into people
- There is some crossover between the two, generally to the detriment of
  both the user and any understanding of the truth. That is, some nephilim use magic to actively seek out or encourage their own possession.
- Scholars have observed that where magic _is_ used to "trigger" prophecy, it
  is **_always_** corrupting, although the degree of corruption differs widely.
- Most frequently, it appears evident that there is a lasting and inheritable
  reduction in the ability to resist magic that stems from the powers of the Seraphim and Thrones.
  - So while in general someone strong in the Thrones could normally resist the
    imperious curse, if they come from a family steeped in the use of divination, then he/she personally will be abnormally susceptible to this magic.
  - A notable counter example is that of the centaurs, who actually became
    _more_ resistant to these forms of magic, but developed weaker wills in other ways. See a more detailed account [here][AC].

### Arithmancy

- Mundane mythology would describe this as being a speciality of divination.
  More accurately scholars understand arithmancy as an attempt to predict the effect of a use of magic. It attempts to make magic scientific. However, it is complicated by the fact that its practitioners themselves do not actually understand the scientific method, nor agree on which mathematical system(s) they are using to do this in. The field is dominated by people with only the vaguest idea of what the mundane world has done with either numbers or science in the past 400 years.

### Legilimency

- This requires both an inheritance from the Seraphim and the Thrones, for
  this work it comes in 3 phases.
  - Passively, it is solely from the Seraphim, and is morally neutral. This
    will tell you a target's emotional state (anything related to brain
    chemistry), whether or not the person is telling the truth (again based on
    brain chemistry and things like pulse rates, but done automatically for
    you by the magic), energy level/alertness, and other purely physical
    things but _not_ about the person's actual thoughts or memories. A really
    skilled user may be able to infer thoughts from this however with a fair
    degree of accuracy.
  - Unidirectionally Outbound, it adds in abilities from the Thrones, forcing
    the recipient to hear your thoughts. This is a bit of a grey area morally.
  - Bidirectionally, you force the victim to reveal their memories, implant
    memories, or manipulate emotional states.
- For some unknown reason, unless the target has at least some magic, you will
  be unable to do more than manipulate emotional states. This manipulation goes beyond the simple transmutation of brain chemicals, it actually causes the brain to release the appropriate chemicals as if naturally in that emotional state.
- All bidirectional legilimency is morally repugnant, and comes at a high risk
  of corrupting change.
  - This change may be physical, spiritual, mental, or any combination
    thereof.
    - Reduced ability to resist concupiscence is the most frequently observed
      change.
    - In some cases this has been significantly noticeable even within a single
      individual's lifespan.
    - In others it has been visible only by comparing across generations.
  - While all use of bidirectional legilimency is morally repugnant, the normal
    distinction between mortal and venial sin is still present. Scholars have observed the following patterns in nephilim who self-report having used this magic:
    - Use of the magic due to fear for self or in defence of others appears to
      produce less harmful changes. Scholars speculate that this constitutes an impaired freedom.
    - Those self-taught in the art appear to go longer before experiencing any
      change. Scholars speculate the delay in effect is due to impaired knowledge.
    - At least one nephil has been recorded who performed legilimency
      unconsciously and required both great training and great concentration to _not_ use this magic. That individual appeared to experience no effects from her use of legilimency except the loss of trust of those around her. Scholars speculate that the lack of freedom involved is key.
  - There is an unknown threshold where the risk changes from a risk of a
    _personally_ corrupting change to an _inheritable_ corrupting change. The purposes for which legilimency was used appear to be critical in determining where this threshold exists.

### Occlumency

- The magical suppression of emotion and with that access to thoughts comes at
  similar moral and magical cost to active legilimency.
- This is a prime example of a defensive magic that harms the user.
- Most nephilim communities believe that ccclumency is the only reliable counter to legilimency. _This is not true._ Scholars have recovered copies of works from individual families that document other ways. Why these are not more generally known is debatable.

### Contracts

The history of the Church's interaction with the nephilim is repeat with examples of individuals who have been bound by magical contracts. There is more than sufficient documentary evidence to establish that at least some of these were created either without the subject's knowledge or even against the subject's will.

Even in the mundane world, arranged marriages were common in much of the world as late as the 18th century.[^220823-1] Just as the Church has been forced to develop norms around the reality that occasionally one or both persons approaching for marriage are under duress, and thus not free to validly celebrate the sacrament, anyone interacting with the nephilim must always be careful of the possibility that one or both nephilim are coerced by a contract. Indeed, so great is the risk that a contract will compel a nephil's behaviour that some Church scholars believe that the nephilim are incapable of a total, free, and faithful gift of self except by exception and luck, and thus ought not be permitted the sacrament at all. Fortunately (for their souls) the nephilim community seems to have largely spontaneously developed societal norms such that these binding contracts are now much less frequent than they were in past centuries.

- See [Magical Contracts][AF] for more details on these contracts.
- See [Soteriology, Missiology and Ecclesiology][AG] for more on the Church's
  speculation on the relationship between the nephilim and the sacraments.
- See [The Nephilim][AH] for more details on the nature and origin of the
  nephilim.

Magically speaking, contracts can be generalised in a few ways, depending on its precise nature.

- A written contract is (unknown to the nephilim) essentially a highly modern
  form of runes. You use magic inherited from the Virtues to give your
  writing power, in this case power inherited from the Thrones to compel the
  will of those bound by the contract. The contract may be further infused
  by the Powers to give it duration, and (almost always) may depend on the existence of the paper/parchment contract to ensure its persistence. Some nephilim communities have realised that destroying the physical contract will (usually) destroy the magical contract.
- Magical Contracts, for unknown reasons, are not nearly as successful at
  binding the will as more specialised magic like the [Imperius] curse. See [Magical Contracts][AF] for details. Nephilim, not understanding the fine
  grained conditions outlined there, do not understand why some contracts work and others do not.
- Some nephilim believe that artefacts can create contracts and bind people
  to them.
  - In actually, these objects have the contract inscribed on them, usually in the form of runes, almost always hidden or obscured from view.
  - These objects cannot unilaterally bind anyone. Users must be bound by
    some action they or a valid proxy (see [Magical Contracts][AF]) take interacting with the object.
  - The most famous of this is the so called "Goblet of Fire." If it were
    ever carefully inspected, runes are lightly scratched around and inside it spelling out the terms of the contract it enforces. These scratches have been preserved and protected by the application of still more magic reinforced by the case the Goblet is stored in between Triwizard Tournaments. Modern users have not taken the time to carefully inspect either.
- Other forms of 'contract' magic leverage the mutable nature of the nephilim
  rather than relying on the power of the thrones.
  - These lack the versatility of written contracts, in that they cannot be
    prepared in advanced by a skilled practitioner with fine-tuned terms,
    conditions, effects, limitations, loop-holes, and all the other things
    that a fallen people have wanted in their agreements over the centuries.
  - Similarly, the contract that lacks a physical representation cannot be
    used as flexibly, one can bind oneself or one's descendants, but not
    a pair of unknown and unrelated persons.
  - Where the written contract uses the magic of the writer, these use the
    magic of those entering into them.
  - Destroying these unwritten contracts after creation is much more difficult
    and practically impossible unless the exact terms are known (such as someone providing a memory of the vow being made).

## Authors notes

Here lets step beyond what might be gleaned by summarising the various works available "in-world."

"Standard" nephilim seem more or less humans with extra abilities, but this is
not really true. If you consider creation as a hierarchy, humanity has always
occupied a messy place - top of the material creation, bottom of the spiritual
order, but destined, through grace, not merit, to be raised above its (our)
natural place. Introducing the nephilim in this fictional world, I am putting
the nephilim as being an unnatural hybrid of two things God created. In making
this hybrid, something of each was lost. They are thus _slightly_ lesser than
humans, and _entirely_ outside the intended, natural hierarchy. Despite having greater capabilities in some ways, they have deficits in others, most notably, they are overall _less free._ Think of mules, they have advantages, in certain circumstances, over both donkeys and horses, but they are not really a stable species at all, and in some ways (specifically fertility) less than either.

Nephil have some aspects of both. They are _mostly_ contingent beings that grow and change over time, but their use of magic is, in this universe, the use of an angelic power, and so it tends to either be 1) incredibly crippled compared to actual angels (for example, charms wear off really fast) or 2) incredibly permanent. In the canon books, you cannot remove Walburga's portrait from the wall without removing the wall, which might have been stupid for a house that will be passed down through generations, but clearly demonstrates that a momentary decision can have effects all out of proportion to the result. I am restricting that to magic used on things without immortal souls and to magic used on _other nephilim_ (or on races descending from nephilim, see [Magical Beings][AC]). Things that would be temptations to a human can be overriding compulsions to a nephil, and they are vulnerable to each other (and to others who can use similar powers) in ways that humans are not.
