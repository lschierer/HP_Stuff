On reading _[Many Waters][MW]_ by Madeleine L'Engle, a number of ideas came
together and I started thinking about the Harry Potter universe in a different
way. Mrs. L'Engle's theology in that book is _really really_ sketchy, but like
many distortions of true Catholic thought, makes for interesting fiction. This
is not really a cross-over, you will not see the characters from any of the
non-Rowling works I am taking ideas from here. Similarly, much of the
"theology" in this work is more like a comic book's depiction of Catholicism
than a true representation. Mark Twain famously wrote that _[Huckleberry Finn]_
has neither motive nor moral,[^230719-1] I will allow that I have the motive
of entertaining at least myself.

As I said, that book caused a me to think about the Harry Potter universe
differently, but it was not until I was reading CmptrWz' _[For Want of
an Outfit][FWoaO1]_ Chapters 30 through 35 that what I am trying for here
_really_ came clear. Left unadulterated, Mrs. Rowling's Harry Potter universe
has too few consequences. I harp on that theme in my [Harrypedia]. This
fan fiction is a harsher universe. Magic, even if not "dark" and
_intentionally_ harmful, cannot always be undone or fixed. There can be not
only life-long repercussions, but _generational_ repercussions from the spells
and potions that are so often carelessly used.

I am taking some things from _[Many Waters][MW2]_, some from C. S. Lewis' _[The
Screwtape Letters][TSL]_, some from actual Catholic theology, some from various
myths and legends, and some from Tolkien's Middle Earth universe. I am grafting
these ideas into the Harry Potter universe, replacing some of its actual world
building with these grafted bits, extending it in other places. The end result
will, like _[Many Waters][MW3]_, be _really really_ bad theology, that's okay
and in fact inevitable (I think) when you mix in the mythological and Harry
Potter elements.

A lot of authors will try to do almost all their world building within the
narrative. I realise this is technically better, but it is also harder to do.
Since I am pulling from several disparate, previously existing, universes that
the reader may well already be familiar with, and because I am _not_ an awesome
writer actually capable of pulling off the vision in my head, I am going to set
the stage and provide some of the world building in the form of Appendices that
authors generally do not publish. These world building notes are useful to
understand the story, but are hopefully not truly necessary. Most (everything in the backstory section) are written from the perspective of a researcher within the universe of the narrative. I have attempted to call out the places where that is not true.

    In _[Error of Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518)_
    Materia-Blade has a line referring to magical folk as Nephilim. I came up
    with this idea well before I found that work. Just goes to show that there
    is nothing possible that _someone_ else hasn't also thought of.
