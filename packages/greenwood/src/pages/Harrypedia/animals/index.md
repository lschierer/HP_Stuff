This section contains information about magical animals in the Harry Potter universe.

There is a huge tendency among fan fiction authors to assume that many, or most magical animals are also sapient. The magical world necessarily creates some ambiguity here. How do you handle a world in which a [sphinx] asks riddles, a [jarvey] insults you, or in which you must _not_ insult a [hippogriff]? Then we have the questions that [parseltongue] poses, and the canonical snakes speaking in books one, two and seven. Even if we accept the back story for [Nagini] from [Fantastic Beasts] and thus set aside book seven (as that snake is actually a person permanently transformed), books one and two remain as stumbling blocks.

My own take, shared by at least some other authors, is that in the case of [parseltongue], the magic inherent in this language imbues in the snake abilities it does not inherently have. See the [parseltongue] page for details. This allows for a nuanced approach to other animals with varying levels of sentience that may or may not actually approach sapience.
