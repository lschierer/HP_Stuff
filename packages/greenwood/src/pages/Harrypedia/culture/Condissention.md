There is no real doubt that most magical people consider themselves, their
lifestyle, cultural institutions and so on superior to non-magical ones. This
is not just restricted to the bigots like the [Malfoy] family. [Mr. Weasley]
is fascinated by non-magical things and people, but still talks about them as
if they are clever children.[^220630-3]

There are two common mistakes that fan fiction writers make dealing with this.

### The First Fallacy: Magical Society _is_ better

The first fallacy is that Magical Society _is_ in fact better. In some ways it
is, in other ways it is not. There might be reasons for some of the traditions
they have clung to, but like any people, some traditions are traditional simply
because they _want to be different._[^220630-4]

As an example of this, phoenixgirl26 in _[Observation][pgO1]_ has [Harry] adopt
this attitude of superiority without question.[^220630-5] He then proceeds to
instruct [Hermione] that robes have pockets _that might be used._ He had to be
_taught_ that you might carry _paper_ in your pocket (except, because magic is
always, better, his actual example was a roll of parchment). I am sorry, but I
figured out that pockets are meant to carry things that might be useful all on
my own, without a class in how the world works. While I do _not_ carry around
a notebook and pen, I have certainly met people who do, and our modern smart
phones essentially replace that need anyway. But [Harry] apparently needs to
be taught this, because he was raised muggle, and non wizarding folk would
never guess that pockets are anything but ornamental.

### The Second Fallacy: Non-Magical Society is always better

Other writers will go to the other extreme. The magical world is just lost in
the past, or worse, simply stupid, and we really just need to join the
non-magical world. You typically see this in stories where either the non-magical
government steps in to take care of things,[^220719-4] where [Harry] leaves the
magical world to live as a muggle, or both. This has ceased to be legitimate
criticism, it is simply bashing on (in this case) a people because it makes the
author feel smart.

A more nuanced approach to this second view might be attempted. An author might
attempt to represent magical society as simply so isolated that the wizarding
populace _is_ in fact largely unaware of things like pens. This approach will
inevitably fall down as well. As I discuss, [paper], and [dip pens] have been
around for _centuries_. These two examples reiterate what I said discussing
[clothing] - that magical society in fact wishes to be _different_ regardless
of what is available or better.

      Note, I actually really like this story because it's strengths overcome its flaws.
