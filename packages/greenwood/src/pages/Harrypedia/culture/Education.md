Oxford was founded between 1096 and 1167, the University of Paris
between 1160 and 1250, the University of Cambridge in 1209.[^210420-3]
The magical culture would no doubt remember the Museion in Alexandria
that was founded between 367 BC and 246 BC,[^210420-4] and ran until
the third century AD,[^210420-5] even assuming they did not use magic
to hide part of it from the non-magical world and survive the
destruction of the rest. The culture would similarly be aware of the
Imperial University of Constantinople, running from 425 to sometime in
the 15th century.[^210420-6] Wikipedia also shows centres of learning in
the right time frame to influence the cultures that would have met in
the ICW to debate the Statute of Secrecy in India and China.[^210420-7]

This is compared to the magical world, that seems to have no institutes of
higher learning, education ends between age 17 and 18 depending on country.
Despite a world-wide population and a culture that values the
long-established and traditional, there are only _eleven_ prestigious
schools _worldwide._[^210420-8] She attributes this to a combination
of wizarding wars and non-magical persecution,[^210420-9] but I think
more is necessary to explain this. I personally like the explanation
given in RoseLilian's work _[The difference a good solicitor makes][tdgsm-1]_.

She describes this view as being a Slytherin one, not necessarily one
held by all, or even most, of the wizarding world. Elsewhere I
speculate that the wizarding culture radically changed with the ISWS,
and that isolationism and the ideas of blood status started to gain a
prominence that they had not previously held. Even assuming that is
true, wizards were _already_ showing a marked difference from their
non-magical neighbours in the realm of education and research. As I
highlight above, the non-magical world was centralising knowledge and
pushing scholarship. The lack of university course work, the idea that
your education is _complete_ at age 17, shows a radically different view in
the magical world. Thus I believe that while this view may not be
universal, and that Ravenclaws in particular may dislike the view, that
it is a common one.

This view would have the happy accident of explaining why in the cannon
books it would not occur to the [Weasleys] to step in and ensure that
[Harry] and [Hermione] know and understand more about the world and
culture they are stepping into, leaving so many holes in our view and
understanding of that culture. A culture of knowledge hoarding and
secrecy would mean that even well-meaning people like the [Weasleys]
would have an unconscious taboo surrounding actually teaching
those outside the family anything not taught at school.
