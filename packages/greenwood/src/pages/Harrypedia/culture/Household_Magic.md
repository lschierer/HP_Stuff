While the books suggest that [Molly] has her children do their chores
largely without magic, I simply cannot see wealthy teen-aged girls going to
social events without magical assistance, be it charms for their hair, magical
replacements for make-up (either charms, potions, or both), charms for clothing
(both for fit and to make the appearance more â€¦ magical), so on. Some of this
may be built into the fabric when it is purchased, but I am reminded of the
descriptions of elfin women in _The Elvenbane_[^210329-20]. In that series,
the women use their appearance and clothing to display their magical prowess,
with the goal of making themselves more attractive as brides. Sure no one talks
much of that in Harry Potter, but I think it is only because it _is_ largely a
child's series, with little attention paid to marriage or the finding of a
spouse (and secondly because the main character is male). The hints of this
_are_ there. [Lily Evens]' magical prowess is referenced over and over again,
even by [Hagrid].[^210329-21] [Neville] comes from a good family, but is
belittled for a supposed lack of power.[^210329-22] [Ginny]'s power is also
remarked upon.[^210329-23]

That aside, if [Molly] is going to teach [Ginny] to cook, is she really going
to teach her to do so entirely without magic? Sure, [Ginny] can peel potatoes,
or chop vegetables, but we see [Molly] making some sort of cream sauce with her
wand, as well as lighting the stove.[^210329-24] Even if you suppose both silent
casting like we see in book six, and a form of casting that does not depend on
precise wand movements, to both turn on a gas stove and light it with a single
poke? It seems more that [Molly] has a stove designed for wand-based operation.
If that is true, [Ginny] would have to use her wand, or at least _a_ wand, to
learn to cook on it. While some families might have house elves, I think that
the world described is sufficiently traditional that most mothers would be
teaching daughters to cook, and thus an exception must exist.

The alternative is that this household magic, which seams to be a mix of charms
(turning on the stove, automating knives) and transfiguration (the cream sauce),
is taught at [Hogwarts]. If so, we should have seen some indication of this in
the six years that [Harry] attends class.
