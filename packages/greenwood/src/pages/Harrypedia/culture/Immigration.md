title: First-Generation “Immigrants”
author: Luke Schierer
---

Assuming that there _are_ real differences between the culture dominating
magical Britain and non-magical Britain, some authors express
frustration with first generation magical users like [Hermione] who
come into this new world essentially as immigrants, and yet make no
effort to learn about their new society before both making value
judgements and demanding that everyone change to conform to the
non-magical value system and culture.[^210220-2] Per this view, it is
the responsibility of the first generation magical user to learn about
the magical culture just like it would be my responsibility to learn about
French culture should I move to France. Just as France and French
citizens would have no special obligation to me, the magical world has
no special obligation to these first generation magic users.

On the face of it, there is some merit to this argument; it is
persuasive, seems consistent, and certainly puts the first generation
magical user on the defensive. This argument has, however, some
significant flaws. Both [Harry] and [Hermione] chose to attend
[Hogwarts], but neither were given full information. Would [Hermione]
have chosen to immigrate to a society where she would be a third
class citizen? Even if she would have, would her parents have allowed
such a decision?

Rowling does not tell us what happens to a first generation child who does
not choose to accept the invitation to [Hogwarts], but the common
speculation falls into two camps. Either the child is simply not
allowed to decline, or the child's magical ability is "bound" or
"suppressed" in some way, and the knowledge of magic removed with
spells such as obliviate. Assuming that either of these is true, then
the analogy to immigration utterly falls down. The first generation
witch or wizard has been forced to enter this society, at "wand point."
If you force me to join your society, then you _do_ bear some
responsibility for teaching me to succeed in it.

The common defence of forcing first-generation magicals to join the new
society is the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy\([ISWS]\). The
argument goes that an untrained witch or wizard would be unable to
control their accidental magic, and would expose the existence of magic
to the non-magical society. This is probably reasonable. Eventually
someone would gain sufficient conscious or even unconscious control
over their magic to start using it in very public and very undeniable
ways. This would eventually lead to investigations into the abilities,
the people who have them. These investigations, done by any competent
government or reasonably sized organisation, would probably eventually
detect enough of the hidden society to deduce its overall existence.

The [ISWS] was only signed by Wizarding Governments, which seem to have a
tenuous relationship with their non-magical counterparts. In Britain,
there is a separate legislature, separate courts, and a separate
"minister," who, based on the interactions we see, _informs_, not
_reports to_ the non-magical Prime Minister.[^210323-5] This makes for
a fairly strong case that while the magical government _may_ in some
nebulous sense still recognise the Crown (though that is certainly not
stated and thus is debatable), it is otherwise an entirely separate
government.[^240508-1]

I am told that under non-magical British law, a child does not
automatically gain citizenship merely by being born within British
borders.[^210323-6] The British magical society seems to take the
opposite view, that anyone born within its jurisdiction _is_
automatically a citizen, and thus _under_ its jurisdiction. While
children do not normally get to contest what government rules them,
their parents typically _do_.[^240508-2] Here we have a situation where a child, by virtue of being
born with a particular trait, is said to be of a different nationality
from the parents said child cohabitates with. The [ISWS] dictates that
this all be kept secret from the non-citizen parents, and prejudice
ensures that these non-citizen parents _have no rights._

[^240508-2]: Illegal immigrants and others who, because they have broken the law, are themselves beyond or exempt from its protection are the exception to this general principle.

Should the child, or the parent acting on behalf of the child, either
break the laws, or even create a situation where the laws are likely to
be broken (by not training the child), the secret government has
enacted regulations such that the child can be irrevocably harmed[^240508-3] and the minds of both parents (who are
NOT under the jurisdiction of the secret government) and child
manipulated and modified.

[^240508-3]: I am assuming the child's ability to use magic is, for lack of a better word, bound. In other words, the child is rendered incapable of violating the [ISWS] in a permanent and lasting way. I strongly suspect the United Nations would consider crippling a child's ability to use any skill harm.

Since the [ISWS] was signed _after_ the separation of the magical and
non-magical governments into effectively separate countries with
overlapping territory, it is unlikely that the non-magical government
had much input into its provisions, rather they were almost certainly
simply informed after the fact, if at all. A government might well
consider itself bound by a treaty signed by a preceding government, but
not by some essentially unaffiliated government. The requirements of
the [ISWS] leave the non-magical government no recourse should (as
essentially happens in Book 7) the magical government become a threat
to the non-magical population. This might have worked in the age of
absolute monarchs, but even in the 1680s and 1690s, Parliament was
curtailing the rights of British monarchs, though not to the extent seen
today. No government that rules by the consent of the governed can sign
away the rights of its citizens to safeguard their children the way the
[ISWS] does.

When the children arrive at [Hogwarts], they are only then told, and
that piecemeal, that they have in fact joined a new society. Since
the consequences of withdrawing from that society are never spelled out,
it is safe to say that they are not known to the children _before_ they
arrive at school. [Hermione] would not have risked practising at home
before first year[^210323-8] if she knew it was illegal. This new
"world" they have joined has customs that they are expected to know,
but will not be taught, laws that they must follow, and _no way out_. Note that I am not challenging the principle that ignorance is no excuse for failing to obey the law. That principle presupposes that one knows that there is a law making body to obey. While it may be a a universal maxim in a practical sense, in a _moral_ sense, if, for example, I honestly do not know not only that

1.  I am in Britain, or
2.  even _that it exists,_ and
3.  have a _legitimate_ reason to believe that I am _somewhere else,_

then I cannot be held culpable for failure to obey Parliament. The fault must belong to the person(s) who created that situation (by placing me there without my knowledge, or otherwise causing me to believe I lived somewhere else).

The students might not have been kidnapped, in that they can go home for a few
weeks at Christmas, and two months or so each summer, but they will
quickly find they fit in less and less at home. They cannot show their
parents anything from school. They know nothing of what has gone on in
the non-magical society for the last four to ten months. Their
non-magical education is frozen at age eleven, so they lack all sorts
of key concepts to even converse with their peers and, increasingly,
with their parents. I suspect that even by the 1600s, this mattered. While few non-magical families would have significant amounts of book-based education, that is to say, few would be significantly literate, there were still skills to learn. If you did not come from a farming family, the mundane child was probably apprenticed out at a
young age anyway. The longer the magical child remains at [Hogwarts], the more likely he or she has missed out on this opportunity. As non-magical society moved into and then
through the industrial revolution and into the modern era, the apprenticeship model changed, but not in ways that would reduce the friction between non-magical expectations of how family works, how society works, and
the more stagnant magical society.

It is in this context that they are then criticised for wanting things
to be the way they were raised to expect. Those who come from old,
aggressively magical families rightly complain that first generation
magical users always want to change things. They are, however, at
fault. Going back to my example, they have placed the child, unbeknownst to that child, in a foreign culture with expectations that it is in fact their native culture. The child, being a child, expects to be able to succeed according to the patterns he or she has learned for the first eleven years of his/her life to expect. The child, being a child, has a right to support from society in being shaped to appropriately fit in with and succeed in his/her culture.

The magical world has created the divide between cultures by refusing to stay
connected with the non-magical world on one hand, and by _forcing_ the
immigration of the first-generation users on the other. If they want
their static society, they have options:

- They can actually abduct the first generation children on the first
  sign of magic. I consider this morally abhorrent, but it would
  work. I think this is what Mrs. Rowling envisions for [MACUSA] but I
  refuse to consider that.
- They can exclude first-generation magical users from magical society.
  This will create risks to the [ISWS], but with careful and aggressive
  use of memory charms, it is also possible that a second, un-hidden
  magical "culture" (or I guess sub-culture, since it would actually
  exist as a sub-component of the surrounding non-magical cultures)
  could develop independent of the [ISWS] culture. I consider the use of
  memory charms morally repugnant, but the [ISWS] pretty much demands it.
- They can give up on the [ISWS]. This does not necessarily require they
  give up on having a separate government and culture, it _does_
  require they give up on the secrecy. That in turn means
  accountability to the surrounding populations, something that I am
  not actually confident that they could survive.

Instead I suspect that some percentage of the magical culture actively _desires_ a permanent underclass that cannot succeed.[^240508-4] They _intend_ the first generation "emigrants" to become the next generation of peasant workers in their shops, manufactories/workshops; to fill the secretarial and clerical positions in the [Ministry]. While this may not be formally slavery, it is still repugnant.

      This view is actually fairly mild in this work, but the idea of mostly undefined "Wizarding Traditions" that
      should be known and practised, and that when not cause the person or family to stand out _and be excluded_
      is mentioned several times.

[^240508-1]: It is worth noting that nearly every author who spends significant time trying to build upon the backstory decides that there is a a _treaty_ between the magical population and the monarch of Britain to establish the [ISWS], the [Ministry of Magic], or both. A monarch does not sign a treaty with his/her subjects. The [Magna Carta] for example was a _charter_ not a _treaty_.
