## Parchment

I think the use of parchment is a an example of Wizarding culture being
deliberately antiquarian. There may also be an element of economic control at
play - parchment is significantly more expensive, and so keeping written works
expensive may be a way to keep the lower classes in line. The extensive use of
parchment even stupid little notes and homework assignments will help keep poor
families away from magical knowledge. If you cannot afford parchment, your
children cannot do as well at Hogwarts, and thus cannot do as well in later life.

## Paper

Paper is _really_ old, being present perhaps as far back as 300 B.C. in
China.[^200816-7] However, it took a while for paper to reach Europe, sometime
around the 11th Century.[^200816-8] Paper was originally viewed with disdain,
unworthy for formal communication, or important works[^200816-9]; something that
would definitely influence the magically community. However, it seems that by the
16th Century or so, paper had largely replaced parchment, driven largely by the
printing press.[^200816-10] The Wizarding world does seem to have a sufficient
trade in books to stock at least two book stores (one in Hogsmeade and one in
Diagon Alley), and I am quite confident that the books give us a view of the press
that the Quibbler is printed on. This means that they do use paper books, and
paper periodicals.

Any number of fan fiction works I've read have speculated that there might be a
magical reason for using parchment instead of paper. Most of these have not
really made much sense given the above. However one I came across recently
does.

The reference is to some of the fragmentary descriptions we have from
[McGonagall]'s lectures on transfiguration. You have to be able to visualise
the object that you are working your magic on. In this light it is actually
easier to see why it might be troublesome to enchant paper. It would be all
too easy to have a charm take hold on only a subset of the fibres involved, and
thus behave erratically across the document. This makes a strong argument for
using parchment (or vellum) for documents that are _actually magical in nature_
(like contracts, tests charmed against cheating, official government or banking
forms, etc), but not for standard every day things (like homework, class notes,
and letters (unless you are including privacy charms)).
