## Quills

The use of quills for writing is another seemingly deliberately
antiquated choice made by the wizarding world. While the quill would
be a common writing instrument in non-magical Europe until the early
1800s,[^200816-5] they were the _common_ writing utensil, whereas the
wizarding world seems to have particularly chosen the more exclusive
[parchment] as its writing surface.

Some writers have speculated that the reason for the sustained use of
the quill may be magical in nature. That the quill may channel the
writer's magic in some way that matters when writing on magical
topics.[^231004-1] If this is true, then the magical population of China,
Japan, and similar cultures where writing with brushes is common must
have precise and magical requirements for the nature of the brushes
used when writing on these topics. This is not impossible, as the
traditional brushes used are _usually_ made of bamboo with natural fibers,
generally animals' hair, for the bristles.[^231004-2]

The counterargument is the lack of variety. Matching a user to a wand
requires a range of wood types and at least 3 types of core materials
to embed within that wood.[^231004-3]

## Dip Pens

For whatever reason, it occurred to me to look up the steel nibbed dip
pens that predated fountain pens, wondering when in non-magical (actual)
history pens started to replace the use of quills. I was really quite
surprised. Apparently pens go _way_ back, the Wikipedia [article][Dip pen] was very Britain centric (which is actually fine for my purposes),
but apparently our earliest pen (a copper one) dates from around 410,
just as the Romans were pulling out of Britain.[^200816-4] It does not
come out and state it, but my guess is that for a long time fine metal
work was _really_ expensive, so, as I said, quills remain the standard
writing utensil until the mass production of steel pens in 1822.[^200816-5]  
Interestingly, according to the article, these type of pens are still
favoured over fountain pens for calligraphy and other artistic works
that require precision and varied thicknesses.[^200816-6]

From this I can draw a couple of conclusions. Magical users would dislike
fountain pens, because they seem drawn to multi-coloured inks (which
are more difficult with fountain pens), and because arts like ancient
runes would need much the same precision that writing calligraphy does.
The dip pen on the other hand, should show no marked difference from a
quill for writing your runes. Both would be substandard to a brush -
there is a reason that Chinese and Japanese languages are painted, not
written when you look at the really fancy stuff. The dip pen could
further be _engraved_ with runes. In the books you see spell
correcting quills, and others with anti-cheating charms. I can see both
of these being done more reliably with runes. You want a dicto-quill?  
Again, you can see how this can be reproduced.

Moreover, magical users are clearly drawn to the aesthetic quality of a
fancy feather. Fountain pens _can_ be artistic, but are generally
fairly utilitarian. Your dip pen on the other hand could be a work of
art. I did a quick Google search on "steel nib feather" for example,
and you can just imagine a wizard using many of those.

## The Right Tools

Given that magical culture favors [parchment], you would then want writing
utensils that work well on it. While I can't speak to how a fountain pen
or ball point pen might work on parchment, a quill or dip pen should
both work equally well on any decent quality paper. While at least one
author has solved this by saying that magic is disrupted by the
inorganic materials in pens, but flows into one's writing when using a
quill,[^230804] there is no canonical basis for this line of thought;
it is pure speculation.
