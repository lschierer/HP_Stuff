The Pensieve is a example of Mrs. Rowling's lack of ability to fully think
things through when it comes to time magic. She says in the description that
it "recreates memories â€¦ taking every detail stored in the
subconscious"[^221202-5] and making of that memory something that can be
entered, re-experienced, and explored.

So why am I including it in time magic instead of memory magic? Because the
examples she gives of its use include [Harry] following details that were
beyond ear-shot and out of the line of sight from the person whose memory he
had entered. I get that the subconscious mind might well have all sorts of
details captured about events that I cannot consciously access. Things that
you saw, but do not consciously remember. Things that you heard, but did not
understand at the time. Perhaps even things that you heard but were to faint
for you _to_ understand might be captured and the sounds amplified by the magic
of the pensieve.

[Snape] could not know that [James] had drawn an "L. E." on his OWL
papers.[^221202-8] This one is a minuscule detail, but one that [Snape]
literally couldn't have known. The book says that [Harry] stood behind
[Snape], read the exam title over [Snape]'s shoulder, then _turned_ before
seeing his father.[^221202-11] He then had to move "across two aisles and up a
third"[^221202-12] meaning that [James] was _behind_ [Snape]. The "L. E."
then was not an unconscious detail that [Snape] observed but did not note in
the sense that I might have all sorts of things in line of sight but not
actually be focusing on them much less paying attention to them. This detail
was literally invisible to him.

But if I _cannot_ see it, if it is **_out of my line of sight_**, then it is
**_not in my memory_** conscious or unconscious. Thus for [Harry] to be
able to see this "L. E." we need something more than [Snape]'s memory. Hence
time magic. If the pensieve is invoking an element of time magic, the
conundrum is solved. Details can be plucked out of the time stream to fill in
those that you _actually don't recall_. Things that you could not have seen.

However, if this is true, if details are being drawn out of time, how did
[Slughorn] ever expect to pass a modified memory off when giving it to
[Dumbledore]?[^221202-9] I think the answer is that the memory _does_
influence what the pensieve shows, that you have not in fact time
travelled[^221202-10] but rather that the pensieve starts with the memory as a
basis and, for lack of a better way of putting it, fills in the details.
Except that these details are _actual history_.

And that is why [Slughorn]'s modified memory is so obvious. Because it is
modified, it corresponds to _no_ actual history, so when the pensieve seeks in
time for details to fill in, there _aren't any_. Anything that he himself does
not provide is simply not present.

However, I suspect that a _truly_ skilled practitioner of the [mind magics]
would not only know this, but would be able to work around it. This would explain why [Dumbledore] says that [Slughorn]'s attempt is "crudely done."[^240422-2] Instead of trying to replace the memory with totally false imagined scene, he or she might, for example, splice two memories. Or perhaps judiciously change a single word here or there to subtly influence the perception that the viewer has of the memory, without preventing the pensieve from finding enough in the memory to locate it in time. To carefully edit only where the memory is most conscious, most present, and thus where details from history are least needed. The pensieve then would be merely a non-interactive holodeck viewer of such a modified detail, with no need to link it in time, since the practitioner edited a segment from which no details are missing. This would not be a "crude" modification, but rather one that [Dumbledore] might term more elegant, but, per his comments to [Harry] probably poses more risks to the practitioner's actual ability to recollect the unmodified event.[^221202-13] It is important to note that if this is either known to be true or speculated to be possible in world, then memories would not be considered admissible evidence in a responsible court.
