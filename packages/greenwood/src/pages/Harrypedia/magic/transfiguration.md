Considered a branch of [magic], this may be the least explained and most
confusing of the classes that [Harry] actually takes. This is interesting,
because even more than [Flitwick], and totally unlike both [Snape] and
[Slughorn], we actually read about [Harry] taking notes in this class. We
just do not have solid information about the _content_ of these notes.

### Animate to Inanimate Transfiguration

The story _[Meaning of One, Part One]_ was written around the time of the
sixth official book. Despite the contradiction with cannon, it brings up an
interesting point. In that story, [Bill] talks about the ancient
[Egyptians] using transfiguration as a trap.[^221220-1] Per the ideas in
that story, the victims of such a trap experience a severe form of sensory
deprivation, and often never fully recover from it.[^221220-2]

Contrast this to [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince], in which
[Slughorn] disguises himself as an arm chair. Rather than experiencing
sensory deprivation, he is acutely aware when [Dumbledore] pokes him with a
[wand], despite being in the form of a chair.[^221220-3]

Did [Slughorn], who certainly did not intend to damage himself, purposefully
only incompletely transfigure himself? Or is Sovran's theory of sensory
deprivation entirely uncanonical, despite its logical soundness?
