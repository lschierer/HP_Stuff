### Physical Appearance

> A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudgeâ€™s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding.[^221213-3]

She has a "booming" voice.[^221213-5]

### About Her

We know very little about Amelia Bones from cannon sources. [Tonks][] says
that she is fair, and thinks well of her.[^221213-2] And sure enough, she is
the only one to follow up on the evidence that [Harry][] presents at his
trial.[^221213-4] Despite that, she allows there to _be_ a trial, and until
this book, we do know know that there _is_ a head of Magical Law Enforcement,
because [Fudge][] appears to be doing the job.[^221213-6] This does not speak
well of her control over her department, her political influence, or the
respect with which she might be held.

[^221213-6]:
    It is after all [Fudge][] who arrests [Hagrid][] and handles
    [Sirius][]' escape from Azkaban. Surely these would normally be the job of a
    Head of Magical Law Enforcement, not the equivalent of the Head of State and
    Government?
