The McLaggen family is apparently well connected, sufficiently so to impress
Slughorn.[^210318-2] Given Scrimgeour's behaviour across book six and the bit
of book seven he is alive for, my guess is that Scrimgeour is not a sympathiser
of the death eaters, but _is_ strongly of the "might makes right" approach to
magic. This is pure speculation, but my guess is that the two families are
probably both old money, and strongly invested in preserving the status quo.
They do not mind first generation magical users per-se, so long as they stay in
their place â€” at or near the bottom of the social order.
