## Analysis

James Potter is one of the more controversial figures in the Harry Potter
series. There is so little information about him, that both fan fiction authors
and just opinion pieces and commentators are working with an almost blank slate.

### From the books

> Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood,[^210128-17]

---

> Harry recognised his father; his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses.[^210128-22]

James' family is well off, his father is described as having quadrupled the
family gold,[^210511-1] and the way it is written implies that this is
_before_ he sold the company. Given the description of wizarding medicine, why
does he need glasses?

---

> James Potter

> Born 27 March 1960

> Died 31 October 1981[^210128-23]

---

> “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”[^230628-1]

---

> “Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James asked
> the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized
> that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.
>
> “My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.
>
> “Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”
>
> Sirius grinned. “Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?”
>
> James lifted an invisible sword. “‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.”[^210128-24]

…

> “Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius.
>
> James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James
> to Sirius in dislike.
>
> “Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”
>
> “Oooooo . . .”
>
> James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip
> Snape as he passed.
>
> “See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door
> slammed. . . .[^210920-1]

James, like [Ron], grew up thinking ill of Slytherin. I sometimes wonder
if that is really the root of most of the controversy between [Lily]
and James. We cannot know from cannon, but imagine a [Lily] who is
very loyal, perhaps slightly irrationally so, to her friends, and one
who holds grudges. The combination is not unbelievable. James has
just insulted her best friend, and will go on to pick on him unmercifully.
Perhaps [Lily] cannot really see James with an unbiased eye until
after she herself has fallen out with [Snape]?

> Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air,[^210128-14]

[Snape] attacks to draw blood; a cutting curse to the neck could kill, to the
eyes could blind. We do not _know_ that this is a dark curse that cannot be
easily healed, but we know that such exist. Even a standard cutting spell could
have killed before anyone could do anything if it hit the carotid artery or
jugular vein. James retaliates with humiliation; cruel yes, on the same scale
as risk of death? Perhaps [Snape] would say yes, but most courts would say
that [Snape]'s crime is worse.

---

> "Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?”

> “Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”

> “What?”

> “He saved his life.”[^210128-5]

---

> your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine.[^210128-8]

We have nothing but [Snape]'s (untrustworthy) word to stay that James knew of
[Sirius]' plans for [Snape] in advance. According to [Lupin], it was
[Sirius] alone who told Snape about the tree,[^210511-2] it is typical of
[Snape] that he blames James for [Sirius]' actions.

> but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back,[^210128-20]

---

> “He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ..."[^210128-6]

---

> “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”[^210128-4]

---

> “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen —”[^210128-7]

---

> “I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle.”[^210128-21]

---

> “No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”
>
> “I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin.[^210128-9]

---

> “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course exceptionally bright, in fact but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers”[^210128-19]

It is interesting that so many people assume that James was a total idiot. I do
not think that a realistic take on his character - I do not think anyone would
say that [McGonagall] is given to false or light praise. We know he was good
at transfiguration, but I think most people dismiss that because his only known
accomplishment is the animagus transformation, and [Pettigrew] also accomplished that. My take is that it is actually a testament to James' skills
that he was able to coach the unskilled [Pettigrew] through the process. I take it as a given that [Sirius] did not have the patience even pre-Azkaban, to help their slower less capable roommate through this achievement. I also wonder what other classes he took, and which ones he did how well at. Did
he take Ancient Runes or Arithmancy? Who was top of the year at Defence?
James' father was famous for potion making, perhaps James did not inherit all
of his father's skills, but it seems unlikely that he did _poorly_ at the
subject - his father would have tutored him over the summers should he have
needed it. [Snape] and [Lily] are prodigies, and [Snape] seems to expect _everyone_ to find potions as intuitive as he does, so I take any disparagement he makes with a fairly large and active amount of suspicion.

[Pettigrew]: /Harrypedia/people/pettigrew/peter/

---

> Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it.[^210128-3]

Normally authors state that _[Lily]_ was the cleverest in the school. At
some point I need to do a similar quote search for her, but this flies in the
face of that.

---

> “I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.”
>
> “You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me ... Here.” He held out his book.
>
> Sirius snorted. “I don’t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.”
>
> “This’ll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it is ...”[^210128-12]

I would have to find the citation, but I know I am not alone in wondering if
this memory was tampered with. The fact that [Lupin] and [Sirius] would
not deny anything in the brief fireplace conversation suggests that it is at
best based on something factual, but then so too are the best lies. It would
be a more cunning and effective plan to subtlety twist the memory to put James
in a worse light, portray [Snape] as a more innocent victim, but leave the
core events sufficiently in place so that when [Harry] describes what he
sees, it rings true to those who witnessed it. The fact that the [pensieve] clearly shows the tampering in [Slughorn]'s memory does not mean it is a foolproof means of doing so.[^240422-1]

[Harry]: /Harrypedia/people/potter/harry_james/
[Slughorn]: /Harrypedia/people/slughorn/horace_eugene_flaccus/
[pensieve]: /Harrypedia/magic/time/pensieve/

[^240422-1]: See my thoughts on the [pensieve].

---

> “You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.”[^210128-10]

[Sirius] implies that James was a daredevil. Is that a true depiction, or a
distortion due to his time in Azkaban? Some of both is the most likely. Even
if true, I strongly suspect that the man who went into hiding to save his son
would not have wanted his son to be as much a daredevil as he himself might
have been in his youth.

---

> Harry wondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the water’s edge.[^210128-11]

[Harry] has not noticed at this point that his mother is one of those girls.
Is James enjoying the attention because he wants _anyone's_ attention, or is he
enjoying it as a (probably mistaken) indication that what he is doing might
attract _[Lily]'s_? Perception is everything, and _[Snape]'s_ memory does
not really tell us what is going on in _James'_ head.

---

> “All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature.

> “Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. “What’s he done to you?”

> “Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “it’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean ...”

> Many of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn’t, and neither did Lily.

> “You think you’re funny,” she said coldly. “But you’re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.”[^210128-13]

See my comments above on possible subtle manipulations of the memory. Still, it
is pretty much established that [Lily] and James did not get along until
either the end of sixth year or, more likely, the beginning of seventh.

---

> Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, “Let him down!”[^210128-15]

She did not like James' behaviour, but she was not fully immune to the humour in
the situation either. At least some of her behaviour is a false front, probably
because she feels she should behave that way, or because she feels she _needs_
to behave that way to get the results she wants.

---

> “Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each other from

>
> “Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just

>
> “I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.
>
> Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what you’ve got

>
> “If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.[^210128-16]

The book does not tell us exactly how detailed a description [Harry] gave the
two of what he say. I really wish it gave us more, it would answer the
question on how accurate the memory was. The thing is that even [Sirius]
here can admit that at least some of what they did was wrong. We cannot be
sure how much, but admitting that you were an "arrogant little berk" means that
[Sirius] has matured at least some from what he was. If [Sirius] can admit
that despite his obvious desire to live in the past, then the change, the
maturation, in James must have been still more profound.

### From Pottermore:

> WAND: Eleven inches, mahogany[^210128-25]

eleven inches is about average for a wand, it does not tell us much about James.
The wood, mahogany, is not one listed on Pottermore's page about wand
woods.[^210511-3]

[Peverell]: /Harrypedia/people/peverell/

### When did he get the Cloak

In book three, [Lupin] refers to seeing James use the cloak many
times.[^210318-4] At first I was inclined to disregard this, the fact that
[Lupin] knows that you still show up on the Marauder's Map implies that it
was at school, but does not prove that. For all we know the two got curious
when James inherited the cloak _after graduation_ and tested the cloak against
the charms they had used. After all, while they had lost the map, as the
creators, they could have recreated enough of its detection mechanisms to prove
the test case, or alternately there may have been multiple copies of the map
originally, only one of which was seized.[^210318-5] However, further down,
he definitively places the cloak in James' possession by at least their fifth
year, as it was used to get out of the castle each full moon.[^210318-6]

Given that he would not officially inherit the Cloak until his father dies, why
was such a valuable heirloom sent with an irresponsible child to school? This
is pure speculation, but one possibility is that James was _not_ as irresponsible as he is made out to be. By 1975 the [Riddle]'s violence was no doubt ramping up, if not already in full swing. We know, reference my discussion of James above, and my discussion of [Snape], that some of the Slytherin students are experimenting with [dark magic]. Perhaps [Fleamont] sent his son to school with the cloak as an additional layer of protection for a
beloved, and yes, somewhat spoiled heir, knowing the boy (James) was feuding
with such evil already. Despite his many illicit forays out after curfew, this
supposedly irresponsible boy kept the Cloak out of larcenous[^210318-7] enemy
hands, despite the fact that he supposedly has no cunning or intelligence.

## Pure Speculation

Consider some of the stuff [Harry] goes through in Books 1 and 2. Given
that, Ian Hycrest speculates that with [Dumbledore][D1] and [McGonagall] even
more distracted by the more active war that was then going on, and with
[Slughorn] trying to avoid [Riddle]'s notice,[^210629-2] there were
probably students openly planning on becoming Death Eaters, and openly
preparing for their proposed careers, probably with no real repercussions.[^210629-3] In such an environment, James Potter, who hated the dark arts,[^210629-4] may have had reasons for his pranks that [Snape] and [Lily] were unwilling to acknowledge. He may, per Mr. Hycrest's theory, have been guilty of poor targeting and have occasionally over-reacted, but he was
_reacting_ not _instigating_.

I am inclined to believe this view. James was, in his own mind, a sort of [Robin Hood] (who some believe may have been an earl) enacting humorous vigilante justice on those who practice [dark magic]. James knew his friends well, so he motivates [Sirius] by playing off the other's boredom rather than appealing to justice or chivalry. Appealing to boredom is more likely to actually motivate. Like the real [Robin Hood], James refuses to take himself seriously, and speaks flippantly of the revenge (he thinks of it as justice) he enacts against them. Those like [Lily] who have emotional attachments to the victims of this outlaw justice are disinclined to see beyond or beneath the light talk to the serious purpose beyond/behind it.

Later, in sixth and seventh year, when [Lily]'s perception is no longer being continuously twisted by her need to defend [Snape], she begins to see him differently. Perhaps too, her comments by the lake in fifth year stung, and he abandoned some of the flippancy that made up part of his [Robin Hood] personae. Not that he took his vengeance less seriously, but that he became less obvious, less open, about taking it.

We know that [Lupin] was chosen as prefect in fifth year, but that James gets the position as head boy in seventh. Lets assume for now that this is _not_ a nefarious plot by [Dumbledore] playing matchmaker. Not because I believe him incapable of doing so, but because I believe him more likely to try to play matchmaker between James and [Sirius] \(to redeem [Sirius]\), or between [Lily] and [Snape] (because he \([Dumbledore]\) believes both that she should forgive [Snape] and that the relationship will be the redemption of [Snape]). The latter is more [Dumbledore]'s style, while the former is more typical of what I take as his tone-deaf nature when it comes to the true reality of love and other people's relationships.[^240422-3] Why then _does_ James get the position in seventh year?

The encounter in tunnel where he saves [Snape] no doubt _does_ have something to do with it. It is clear that [Dumbledore][D1] believes that James was innocent, even though [Snape] insists that both [Sirius] and James were coequal collaborators. I think this incident is, however, necessary but insufficient to explain the choice. James had already received a reward for the action that had happened, when the choice for head boy was made, over a year ago. His rescue of an enemy probably made him _eligible_ for the position, made [Dumbledore][D1] rethink and revisit his mental impression of the young James Potter, but I doubt this represents a second reward for the one action. Rather, I suspect that there is something going on in the void of information we have surrounding James Potter. Something his bitter rival \([Snape]\) does not care to share, and no one else bothers to mention (just as no one bothers to tell [Harry] _anything_ of note about [Lily]). In my mind there are two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, they might both be true.

1. James is in fact the [Robin Hood] type figure he sees himself as. More, much of the younger students across three of the four houses _also_ see him this way. He is their protector, the one they turn to when the staff continuously fails to hold the dark in check.
1. After the phenomenal OWL results that would later cause her to name him one of the cleverest students in the school, [McGonagall] has been using him as a tutor for students struggling with transfiguration (and perhaps other subjects?). Perhaps this was her way of trying to keep him too busy to cause trouble. Either way, James, familiar with coaching those struggling from his (successful) efforts at helping [Pettigrew] with the [animagus] transformation, is wildly successful as a tutor of the easier age-appropriate magics.

If either or both of these is true, James might well have been something of a peer leader across the school despite not being a prefect. As such he might well have been an obvious choice to an unbiased observer no matter how much [Snape] resents the choice. Either or both of these might also have influenced [Lily] to begin to reevaluate him as soon as her friendship with [Snape] was (pardon the pun) severed. For I refuse to believe that his ([Snape]'s) continual influence, proclaiming his own innocence (which she wanted to believe) and Potter's guilt had no effect on the impression that lead to the one encounter between them we see in [Snape]'s memory.
