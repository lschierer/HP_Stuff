### On Adults in General

One of the challenges I have noticed across children's and young adult's
literature is how to deal with adults. If you have a set of adults who are both
competent and _good_, why would a child be the protagonist? Any adult in his or
her right mind sympathises with [Molly] in wanting to protect the children from
all that is harsh in the world. We may not carry it to the extremes that she
does, but we understand her motivations. Thus when [Dumbledore] says that
he wants to preserve [Harry]'s childhood,[^210521-7] we _want_ to believe
him. For the alternative is to face the possibility that the man who leads the
fight against evil is complicit in it.

To create a situation in which a bunch of teens must repeatedly save the world,
Mrs. Rowling compromises all of her adult characters. Some of them are
compromised by situation, but the majority have fatal flaws. It is a testament
to her ability that so many of these characters never the less come across as
_good people_ struggling in _really bad situations._ In these [Notes], I
intend to pull no punches. I will expose these flaws for what they are. I am
going to try to show which characters are good people who do bad things, and
which are bad people who do good things. If, however, any of the adults in
[Harry]'s life were really unreservedly praiseworthy, he or she, and not
[Harry], would be the main character from that point forward.

I have read a few fan fictions that try to find a middle ground. Essentially it
consists of an evil, or at minimum a deeply misguided [Dumbledore]. One who
differs from [Riddle] only in that neither can handle the other being in
control, and in some of the _details_ but not the general shape of their vision
of the world. With two powerful forces acting against [Harry], the competent
adult is overwhelmed, and unable to fully shield him. I cannot say that is is
entirely unbelievable. [Dumbledore] does, or more often fails to do, a great
many things that make him an incredibly ambiguous figure. It is not a great
leap to paint him as the Dark Lord of the prophecy, who has marked [Harry],
not physically, but metaphorically, as the one who could be his equal.[^210521-8]

    This idea is not originally mine, but I do not remember which
    fan fictions I have read it in. If I come across them again, I will note
    them here.
