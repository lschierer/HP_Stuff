  Harry's Genetic Make-up
author: Luke Schierer
collection: Harrypedia
---

Periodically a reader of fan fiction will come across the idea that [Harry] has been bespelled in some way that affects his appearance.[^250204-1]  Most typically, once the magic, whatever its form, has been removed, [Harry] is said to look "more feminine," although occasionally a slightly more realistic author will instead simply say "more like his mother."  I get that many readers react *very* strongly to, and against, the way we see [James] and [Sirius] behaving as bullies in the [Snape's Worst Memory] and some of the other flash-back scenes. The choice that Mrs. Rowling made to demonise [James] as part of her redemption of [Snape] is one of the things that I most dislike about a series that I otherwise like, (and obviously enjoy nit-picking).  I would that she had chosen a different direction for [James]' character.  That does not, however, excuse making a mockery of genetics.

There are several things wrong with the premise these authors are working from.

1. Children *do* sometimes look remarkably like one parent.  I have seen pictures where, without the context to know what year it the picture is from, context in the form of other people in the picture, the clothing, or the situation, you cannot tell if it is me or my dad in the picture.  I know that others have remarked on that resemblance as well.  I have seen the same phenomena between other close relatives a few times.  It is not incredibly common, but it does happen.
1. While children *are* frequently in some way a mix of traits from both parents, that does not mean that the (depending on the year the story takes place in) 11 to 15 year old boy should (if not for magic) appear "more feminine."  Boys appear ... boyish even if they have their mother's hair colour, inherited from her some facial structure (perhaps a pointy chin, a prominent nose, or the shape of the eyes among other possible examples), or her height (or lack there of).  Girls appear girlish even if they inherit from their father some physical traits.  This gender difference would be accentuated as the boy, or girl, enters their teens with the physical changes that happen during those years. The denial of this is way too mixed up with the modern gender delusions to be acceptable.
1. Even if [Harry] *should* show a more mixed genetic heritage than he canonically does, he would not have "black hair with red tips" That is a product of hair dye, not of natural hair colouring.

That being said, I will admit that the books *are* more than a bit absurd themselves.  They emphasise over and over again that [Harry] "has [Lily]'s eyes" and yet he inherited is father's near-sightedness.  This is ... illogical.  Sure, near-sightedness *is* often hereditary, but then he would have *his father's eyes* (at least in shape, colour clearly has no impact on focal distance).  Two wrongs (or more) wrongs do not make a right.
