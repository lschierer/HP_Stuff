    Comments: Chapter 3 has an interesting idea of the students not caring about
    the house cup after 5 years of Slytherin wins. Because of its one-shot per
    chapter nature, this story could end up in any number of categories. Chapter
    20 is also interesting because of its perspective on the Line Continuation
    Act, which I have seen in other works.

    Comments: * So far the good: * So far all of the characters are real people
    whom the author appears to intend to develop as such. They are not straw men
    who exist to be bashed. * [James] and [Sirius] get credit for being top
    students. * Not everyone who is ever mentioned in the canonical works is in
    their class. There are a wide range of ages. * The rise of the Death Eaters
    is realistically portrayed. I actually cannot emphasize this one enough. The
    series weaves in plot elements from Mrs. Rowling's list of ministers and
    other [secondary sources], preserving them realistically, and yet creating a
    distopian situation such that when in [book two] Dobby tells us that things
    are better, we can see that they really are. * [Lily] grew up in the
    non-magical 60s and 70s. There are cultural implications to this that the
    author handles delicately, but also does not shy away from. * The author has
    this interesting plot theme where the main characters internal dialogs and
    externally infered motivations seem continually at variance. This is is
    *really* interesting, especially when you consider what [Harry] will later
    be told, and who will be doing the telling. * So far the neutral: * There is
    an interesting accusation that [Lily] gets the prefect badge as a political
    statement by [Dumbledore]. She is certainly *not* the top student who is
    naturally expected to get it. As the work progresses, this actually makes
    sense in the context of the story. * In our [primary canon], [Snape] is so
    into potions that even as defense teacher, supposedly his dream job, we see
    him brewing. Here that almost appears to be a secondary interest to him,
    though perhaps a growing one. * The author uses the fannon patronymic theme
    for [James] and [Sirius]. I know of no non-fan fiction basis for this. It
    makes me wonder what other fan fiction tropes I myself unconciously
    accepting. * So far the bad: * There is this weird backstory element that
    *[Lily]* first crushed on *[James]* in (I am unclear which) third or fourth
    year. She was mocked for it. Admittedly it makes objective sense for [James]
    to have been a typical boy who is slightly disgusted with the idea of girls
    while young and immature. It is equally fair to state that [Hagrid] is not
    the most reliable source of historical information. Still and all, I would
    have chosen to have her crush on someone else. * The story seems to
    underplay [James]' ability in transfiguration. I don't disagree with the
    author's choice to make [Sirius] overall more brilliant, but in this *one*
    subject, I would have had [James] shine unless there is a snippet that
    suggests otherwise I am forgetting.
