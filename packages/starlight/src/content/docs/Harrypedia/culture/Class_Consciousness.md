I wrote an entire page on [class and blood].

Beyond those notes, I think it really interesting when Mrs. Rowling states that
a [Malfoy] ancestor argued against the ISWS, was active in "high-born Muggle
circles, and that much of the family wealth comes from the non-magical
world.[^210420-12] This provides an additional potential motivation for the
dislike of the first generation "immigrants" and concordant emphasis on blood
status. The [Malfoys], and families like them, may well want the ISWS to
fail.[^210420-13] They want the ISWS to fail not because they like
non-magicals, but because they dislike the restrictions on making money off of
the non-magicals. They may have successfully transitioned and found new sources
of wealth, but interacting with the muggle economy will always be, in a sense,
free money to those with the most ambition and the fewest moral scruples, those
willing to "use any means to achieve their ends."[^210420-14]
