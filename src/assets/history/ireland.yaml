    blurb: Henry VIII of England declared King of Ireland.
    description: |
      This was done via the Crown of Ireland Act of 1542, 
      passed by the Irish Parliament.  This was probably
      done to deal with Henry's heresy.  However, it would later 
      be recognized by Catholic leaders (including the Church) when
      Mary came to the throne.  There would never again be a
      *fully* independent Irish monarch.
