These stories that are really about Fred and George, more than they are about Harry himself.

    <dd>Comments: It is [Chapter 12. Ickle
        Ronnikins](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12) that caused me to
        bookmark this one, though other chapters are worth mentioning.  This
        chapter is a truly dark look at certain canon events from Ron's childhood
        culminating in an alternate ending.  Most of these stories are very dark.
        Only about half have ideas worth reading.</dd>
