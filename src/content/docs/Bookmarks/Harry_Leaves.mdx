    <dd>Comments: This is primarily noteworthy for a couple reasons<ul>
        <li>You rarely see [Professor Sprout][] get called out for her behavior in book four.</li>
        <li>This is the second work I have seen with [Baron Samedi].  The idea of using evil against evil is middling interesting.</li>
        <li>The idea that the tournament means that [Harry][] is an adult is used as a plot device.</li></ul></dd>

    <dd>Comments: This story leaves the question of [Horcruxes][] in an ambiguous
        state.  It is surprisingly complete picture of [Harry][] for such a short
        one-shot, but at the expense of any real epilogue to give a sense of
        closure.  There are a number of things I like in this that are mentioned
        but not fully explored.  The author did write a sequel, but it is not
        nearly as interesting.<ul>
            <li>[Harry][] realises that many of his problems are self caused in one
                sense, but the root cause is the effectively random oscillation between
                expecting him to handle things as an adult (which he isn't yet) and
                totally consign responsibilities over *to* the adults (despite the fact
                that he can see they are failing at handling things).  I experienced
                this oscillation myself growing up, and it *does* make responding
                correctly very difficult.  As a parent now, I also see the other side,
                how difficult it is to *not* do this to children.</li>
            <li>[Harry][] realises, looking back, that part of the separation from his
                friends was his own fault.  We do not however, see more than hints of
                the *outcome* of this realisation.</li>
            <li>This story lets [Harry][] be an unusually strong wizard (most people
                cannot do nearly the wandless magic he can) without being overpowered
                (despite his prowess, without a wand he is still too weak to matter in
                a straight up magical fight).  In other words, we can see him as the
                one marked by the "Dark Lord" as "his equal."  I've argued that you
                cannot really do that even in the actual canonical books.</li></ul></dd>
