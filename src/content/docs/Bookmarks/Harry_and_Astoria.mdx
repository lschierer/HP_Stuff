title: Harry and Astoria
description: HP stories with Harry and Astoria Greengrass paired
author: "Luke Schierer"
---

It is relatively rare to find this as a primary pairing, most often these
stories feature some type of revenge on [Draco]
instead of a positive relationship between these two as a primary pairing.  I
am not interested in violating marriage vows as a form of revenge, momentary
pleasure, or drunkenness.  

These stories will focus on a version of [Astoria]
that build off of the *lack* of detail we have about her character.  Mrs.
Rowling's descriptions about the decision process that, in the cannon material,
lead to her marriage is incredibly vague and in some ways even suggestive.
These stories take that vague suggestion and run with it.

        (non-magical) subjects, some Slytherins join, and history changes.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: When [Ron] and [Hermione] both abandon [Harry] after he is
        selected by the Goblet of Fire, [Harry] is alone.  When [Astoria]
        unexpectedly reaches out to him, there is nothing left to hold him back.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: A massively extended one-shot, had this been broken down into
        chapters it would probably be more readable.  The pure-blood princess is
        confronted with her prejudice, but is a decent enough person to grow from
        the experience.</dd>
