title: "HP Stories with Harry and Daphne paired"
author: "Luke Schierer"

[Daphne][] is one of those blank slate characters that authors can do anything
with.  Sure enough, they certainly have, though there do tend to be patterns.
Most of them are not worth reading, but enough are that this becomes a category
to watch.

    <dd>Comments: This story and its sequel are enough to make you interested in
        this pairing no matter what else you might otherwise think.  [Daphne] is
        believable, [Ginny] is reasonably well done, the only real change is that
        [Harry] has caught on to the fact that [Dumbledore] is not to be trusted early
        on in sixth year.  Everything flows from that.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: Featuring a slightly super-powered [Harry], this one also features
        a believable [Daphne], and in some ways a better [Ginny] than _the Importance
        of Intent_.  The super power deviation is presented in a way that makes it
        a logical branch point from the original books, and does not badly
        detract, but overall the [Harry] in this one is somewhat less believable.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This story feels more or less like satire, or what many in the
        fan fiction community call "crack."  Either way, it was very enjoyable
        despite a couple of minor plot holes and homonym problems.  The premise
        is a binding marriage contract that [Daphne][] wants to get out of, and
        [Harry][] cannot resist being the hero.</dd>
