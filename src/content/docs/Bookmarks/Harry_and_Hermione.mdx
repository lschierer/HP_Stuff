I am not often a fan of [Hermione][] as a romantic partner for [Harry][].  That
being said, occasionally you come across one that, despite the pairing, is
incredibly well done.

    <dd>Comments: Harry starts dating Hermione in the time-gap between Halloween and the first
        task of the TriWizard Tournament.  He discovers that Dumbledore could have
        declared the initial champion selection invalid, and that the Goblet of Fire
        is much more powerful than most people want to admit.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: I really think that RobSt bases his stories almost entirely off
        the movies and not the books.  That being said, I am including another of
        his stories because he has some good stuff in them despite his choice of
        pairing for Harry.  In this case, what I really like is the way
        [McGonagall][] is forced to face the consequences of her blind faith in
        [Dumbledore][].  It is also nice to see a problematic [Molly][] while
        [Ginny][], though a minor character, remains firmly in [Harry][]'s corner.</dd>
