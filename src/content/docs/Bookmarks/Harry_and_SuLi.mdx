For some reason this pairing is incredibly rare, and even more rarely are these
stories actually finished.  I am unsure why, as Cho's character in the cannon
books is clearly not a good romantic match for Harry, and yet the introduction
of chinese culture allows for some interesting crossovers, or at least minor
additions to the canon universe.

    <dd>Comments: The Resurection Stone is incredibly dangerous, perhaps the most
        dangerous of the three Hallows.  This story explains one way that is
        true.</dd>
