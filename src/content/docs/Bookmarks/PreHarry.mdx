    <dd>Comments: Chapter 3 has an interesting idea of the students not caring
        about the house cup after 5 years of Slytherin wins.  Because of its
        one-shot per chapter nature, this story could end up in any number of
        categories.  Chapter 20 is also interesting because of its perspective on
        the Line Continuation Act, which I have seen in other works.</dd>
