    <dd>Comments: Chapter 3 has an interesting idea of the students not caring
        about the house cup after 5 years of Slytherin wins.  Because of its
        one-shot per chapter nature, this story could end up in any number of
        categories.  Chapter 20 is also interesting because of its perspective on
        the Line Continuation Act, which I have seen in other works.</dd>

        Note: This is unusual in two primary ways. 1) I am bookmarking something I haven't finished reading 2) I am bookmarking something neither complete nor abandoned.

        Comments: 
        * So far the good:
          * So far all of the characters are real people whom the author appears to intend to develop as such.  They are not straw men who exist to be bashed.
          * James and Sirius get credit for being top students.
          * Not everyone who is ever mentioned in the canonical works is in their class.  There are a wide range of ages. 
          * The rise of the Death Eaters is realistically portrayed. 
        * So far the bad:
          * There is this weird backstory element that *Lily* first crushed on 
            *James* in (I am unclear which) third or fourth year. She was mocked for it. 
          * The story seems to underplay [James]' ability in transfiguration.
