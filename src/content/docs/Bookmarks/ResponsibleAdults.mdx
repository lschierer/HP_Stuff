title: Adults Adulting
description: HP stories with responsible adults
author: "Luke Schierer"
---

So often children's literature is possible because the adults in those stories
are incompetent.  Sometimes they are well-meaning, sometimes they are not,
sometimes they are *trying* and failing, other times they are effectively
negligent.  Sometimes they are simply effectively absent.  Irregardless, the
story is only possible because children are doing things that adults should
have taken care of.  The Harry Potter series is no exception, though it differs
from many in that it features adults in *all* of these categories.  

This is a collection of fan fiction stories that are note-worthy primarily
because they showcase some aspect of adults being … adults.

    <dd>Comments:  This is a series of one-shots, so it is tempting to bookmark
        individual chapters.  The first chapter features a responsible Poppy
        Pomphrey taking Hagrid to task over the dragon.  Some of the following
        chapters are simply silly, but chapter 5 is mildly interesting, and 6-7
        have some interesting nuggets in them.  Chapter 8 is a disturbing might
        have been.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This relatively short one-shot features a neighbour of the
        [Dursleys] looking back and explaining to a younger relative how it is
        that he, and the rest of the neighbourhood, came to overlook [Harry]'s
        living situation.  It then enters the Responsible Adult alternate universe
        by positing that people might have realised that Petunia was lying about
        [Harry]'s secondary schooling and treated him like a missing child.
        This story is noteworthy because prior to reading this, despite the fact
        that I am, or ought to be (based on my own rants on the topic), fully
        aware of just how caste based English society can be, I had overlooked
        just how effective Petunia's lies would have been to that audience.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: What would happen if someone saw [Harry] between when he was
        left in the basket outside the [Dursleys] and when Petunia found him the
        next morning?  While most people who stay in the magical world may not
        have an ounce of logic, not all *do* stay, and one woman without magic can
        do more that most magicals expect anyway.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: What if Vernon and Petunia *didn't* hide the letter, and thus
        Hagrid *wasn't* [Harry]'s first introduction to magic?  In this story,
        Tom the bar keep is that introduction, just as the Leaky Cauldron
        officially opens.  Hufflepuff [Harry] spends the year keeping his head
        down and isolated from the rest of the school, only to be suddenly
        attacked by [Riddle]'s wraith at the end of the year.  As a Hufflepuff,
        he has rather more of a support network than as a Gryffindor.  This really
        should have been developed at least a chapter or two further.  Some key
        things are left unanswered, but it is an intriguing start unfortunately
        marked complete.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This one features an out of character [Snape].  I am unsure
        how much of his speech patterns are an affectation of the role he is
        playing, and how much is the author's interpretation of the character.  If
        the former, it is brilliant, if the latter, it is a flaw.  It would
        require a second chapter were we see [Snape] talking to others to begin to
        figure out which is going on though.  What makes this one memorable is the
        back and forth between [Snape] and Petunia, with [McGonagall]'s
        introspection interspersed.  Petunia does a masterful job of *destroying*
        [Dumbledore] and [McGonagall], only to be equally *destroyed* by [Snape].
        Meanwhile [McGonagall] shows that underneath all that tarnish there
        really is some silver by realising that much of what is happening is
        deserved on all sides.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: Considering British Common Law does not have a concept of
        Emancipated Minors, I rather doubt that either Wizarding Law or Goblin
        law does.[^221214-2]  Other than that Americanism, much of this work is
        a very much needed critical look of what would happen if the non-magical
        world actually *did* decide to intervene in the Harry Potter books.
        Overall, I suspect it is reasonably accurate.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This is one of several works by this author in which [Vernon]
        directly or indirectly pushes for [Sirius] to have a trial as a means
        of getting rid of [Harry].  I include in it in this section because
        he is, whatever his motives, forcing the other adults to act
        responsibly, however unwillingly they do so.</dd>

        different if nearly any adult had been willing to take responsibility
        for dealing with [Snape]'s behaviour towards students.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: I am reluctantly putting this story into this category.  While
        the story features a number of incredibly irresponsible adults,
        ultimately [Hermione] is, although I doubt she realises it, able to
        succeed because she ends up in the care of a few who do, for a variety
        of reasons, take some level of responsibility.  The most interesting
        things about this story is the detailed thought that has gone into
        addressing both [Hermione] as a flawed character and the wizarding
        culture into which she enters.  While I dislike a few of the author's
        decisions, I *really* like some of the author's ideas on the culture,
        and the honest look at [Hermione] is refreshing, especially for an
        author who features her so prominently.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: [Legally Blonde](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250494/) might
        have been made for a Harry Potter crossover.  A lawyer who cannot quite
        fit in totally fits in with the way Mrs. Rowling depicts wizards as
        being unable to quite grasp non-magical fashion.   The contrast between
        [Elle Woods] and [Umbridge] is incredibly funny.  I have seen this
        tried a few other times,[^lbcx] but none do it quite so well.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: This is yet another collection of one-shots.  In fact, several
        one-shots per chapter.  The first snippet in Chapter 1 is … unlikely.
        [McGonagall] will not be proactive that way.  The second is better.
        The third is an awesome AU.  The one marked "5" in Chapter 2 shows what
        it would take to redeem [Lupin] as a character.  The one marked "6" is
        what I would *like* to see in a Goblet of Fire fan fiction.  Too often
        these involve bashing characters instead.  "7" in Chapter 3"
        demonstrates exactly what is wrong with [Snape]'s obsession with
        [Lily].  #s 8-10 are effectively a single work.  It shows a redeemed
        [Sirius].  #12 (Chapter 4) shows a redeemed [Sprout].  #13 is
        fatally flawed - though it shows why [Snape] could not have delayed
        his return, by showing what would have happened had he done so.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: I dislike the way the choice of title and some of the handling of
        the first scenes legitimizes [Harry]'s choice in this, but it is for the
        time after he leaves non-magical care that I am noting this story.  The
        idea that a few adults merely needed a slight push to rock them off of
        dead centre is an interesting one.  I think the author did reasonably but
        not great with [Neville] and his grandmother.  There are hints of the
        transition that would have taken place with the tutor offsetting the
        negative influences in young [Neville]'s life.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: My personal theory is that [Azkaban] truly messed with
        [Sirius]' brain, and that the man we meet in the books is not at
        all the man he was before them.  That being said, he is *rarely*
        given a fair representation in fan fiction, and it is nice to
        see a different take for once.</dd>

        Comments: This story has a number of thought provoking elements, but   
        is ultimately fairly obviously establishing an alternate universe.
        * In this story, soul magic is inherently dangerous, society knows 
          this, but did not know [Riddle] was using such magic until too late.
        * It is strongly implied that the Death Eaters made magically binding
          oaths to [Riddle] that oblige their obediance.  Many of their children
          are aware their family members regret these oaths.
        * Society has responded by adding a class on Magical Theory to 
          [Hogwarts].  This puts a very different slant on the [Slytherin] students, which the author has used to different degrees in different particular students.
        * There are some inconsistencies in its definitions of magical 
          classification.  This may be because the book admits that knowledge
          is generally hoarded and not shared, as research requires for success.
        * Magical mind healing is considered a real profession in this work.
