	* Comments: [Ginny][], [Ron][], and [Hermione][] are allowed to see key
	  scenes from [Harry][]'s past. But are these just visions, or can they
	  change the future?  This story departs from much of what happened in
	  books six and seven. It assumes that [Dumbledore][HpediaD1] and his
	  allies *did* train [Harry][], secretly, and that training was just as
	  brutal and inhumane, in its own way, as his early life. Unlike the
	  epilogue of the real book seven, this story shows a real relationship
	  between [Harry][] and [Ginny][], and realistically named children result.

    * Comments: Harry spends a few days as a student in his parents' seventh
      year just after wining the canonical battle.  He reveals very little while
      he is back there, but is responsible for encouraging
	  [Lily][] to reevaluate her relationships, and [Dumbledore][HpediaD1] to
	  trust the prophesy.

    * Comments: Ron dies in Gringotts, Ginny and Hermione in the battle of
      Hogwarts.  Harry has to flee after retrieving the Diadem but before
      obtaining the means to destroy it.  He eventually learns everything he
      needs to win, but England is gone.  He goes back and time, quite insane.
      The Sorting Hat reluctantly allows him to change future history.

    * Comments:  For any given filter, no matter how reasonable, there is an
      exception.  I am not usually a fan of pairing Hermione with random
      adults.  However, a time traveller who remains in her adult body
      interacting with other adult characters lacks much of the creepy factor
      that makes that so objectionable.  This work features the many-worlds
      theory of time travel.  I admit I prefer the approach where you actually
      change the past and thus, if you can return, the present you return to.
      That being said, there is much that is well done in this story.  Of
      particular note, it is said at multiple points that [Riddle][] probably
      intended to create his final [horcrux][] with [Harry][]'s death.  What
      artefact did he intend to use?
