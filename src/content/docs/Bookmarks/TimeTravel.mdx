    <dd>Comments: [Ginny], [Ron], and [Hermione] are allowed to see key
        scenes from [Harry]'s past. But are these just visions, or can they
        change the future?  This story departs from much of what happened in
        books six and seven. It assumes that [Dumbledore] and his allies
        *did* train [Harry], secretly, and that training was just as brutal
        and inhumane, in its own way, as his early life. Unlike the epilogue
        of the real book seven, this story shows a real relationship between
        [Harry] and [Ginny], and realistically named children result.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: Harry spends a few days as a student in his parents' seventh
        year just after wining the canonical battle.  He reveals very little while
        he is back there, but is responsible for encouraging[Lily] to reevaluate
        her relationships, and [Dumbledore] to trust the prophesy.</dd>

    <dd>Comments: Ron dies in Gringotts, Ginny and Hermione in the battle of
        Hogwarts.  Harry has to flee after retrieving the Diadem but before
        obtaining the means to destroy it.  He eventually learns everything he
        needs to win, but England is gone.  He goes back and time, quite insane.
        The Sorting Hat reluctantly allows him to change future history.</dd>

    <dd>Comments:  For any given filter, no matter how reasonable, there is an
        exception.  I am not usually a fan of pairing Hermione with random
        adults.  However, a time traveller who remains in her adult body
        interacting with other adult characters lacks much of the creepy factor
        that makes that so objectionable.  This work features the many-worlds
        theory of time travel.  I admit I prefer the approach where you actually
        change the past and thus, if you can return, the present you return to.
        That being said, there is much that is well done in this story.  Of
        particular note, it is said at multiple points that [Riddle] probably
        intended to create his final [horcrux] with [Harry]'s death.  What
        artefact did he intend to use?</dd>
