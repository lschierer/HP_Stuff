### Overview

Since I need non-Mendelian inheritance to explain both magical creatures and the
nephilim themselves, I am going to set some rules.  These are primarily for the
nephilim, the inheritance for magical creatures may follow modified versions of
these rules depending on exactly how the creature in question came to exist.
These rules are hierarchical, that is you need to apply the rules in order to
determine what happens to a given child.

1. Children born of at least one magical parent have a 80% chance of following
   these rules, and a 20% chance of following purely human inheritance patterns,
   which I will refer to as Mendelian genetics for simplicity.  If they follow
   Mendelian genetics, any magical abilities will tend to degrade with each
   generation that follows Mendelian genetics. In other words, they will become
   more and more normal, more and more in line with the way the world would have
   worked without disruption or intervention.
1. Children not following Mendelian genetics will have a 80% chance of still
   following Mendelian for traits not influenced by the deviation that
   distinguishes them from the mundane (in the nephilim this includes height,
   skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, so on).
1. For every generation that a mundane trait *does not* follow Mendelian
   genetics, the odds that the next generation also will not increases by 10%.
   Thus things like Weasley red hair (many generations), or Potter hair (at
   least 3 generations) start to become non-mundane traits.
1. For non-mundane traits, a male child will have (a female child has similar
   numbers, but switch father/mother). This is computed *per trait*.
    * a 50% chance of inheriting solely from his father,
    * a 16% chance of inheriting the sum total of both parents,
    * a 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,
    * a 7.5% chance of a partial inheritance from just his father,
    * a 7% chance of inheriting solely from his mother,
    * a 4% chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother,
    * a 1% chance of something truly bizarre happening
    * a 0.5% chance of becoming mundane,
   Originally, centuries in the past, people tended to be highly specialised
   into one of these.  If you inherited an angelic nature as a single unit,
   there would be a 30% chance of a child mixing the magical/angelic heritage of
   his/her parents.  Since instead my thought is that each is an independent
   trait, each of which has a 30% chance, mixing is pretty much guaranteed to
   happen fairly rapidly.  In practice, in the modern era, every child invited
   to a magical school has a reasonably mixed heritage, though the precise
   values 1-10 for each category differ significantly from child to child.
1. Recall that I said that magic can be inherently corrupting.  Magic that is
   corrupting not only affects the user, but his/her descendants, four
   generations out.  All magic that *requires* an emotional content
   (unforgivables require hatred, the patronus requires positive emotions, so
   on) fits in this category.
   - by corrupting, I do not necessarily mean that it tends the user towards
     evil, I mean that it tends to change (corrupt) the nature of the user.
   - This corruption is *caused* not necessarily by the magic itself, but 
     because angels regularly act to ensure that magical rules they themselves 
     have created are followed. See [Appendix F][AF] and [Appendix G][AG]. 
   - magic where the required emotion closely aligns with one or more of the
     seven deadly sins tends to corrupt the user more severely and more rapidly
     (both) than magic where the required emotion is either neutral or closely
     aligns with a virtue.
   - Magic that aligns with a virtue *still corrupts*, it simply does so less
     severely, more slowly (and thus less likely to happen literally over
     night), and/or the change is less likely to be inheritable.
   - Magic that *requires* emotion tends to have very low, very real
     thresholds.  Magic that is merely *affected* by the user's emotions tends
     to allow for greater ranges of use without hitting thresholds.
   - It is theoretically possible, but in practice highly unlikely, that the
     changes induced by different magics requiring opposing emotional contexts
     might cancel each other out.
   - Intent matters, if the threshold was crossed due to malicious intent, the
     corruption tends to be more crippling, where the threshold was crossed
     despite benign intent, or out of fear for self or others, the corruption
     tends to be mitigated in odd unexpected ways.
   - While all emotional magic falls in this category of corrupting the user,
     there are other classes of magic that do as well.
   - Magic that *decreases* free will of the *target* has *incredibly* low thresholds.
     - The [Imperius] curse
     - the Confundus curse
     - some uses of memory charms
   - Use of a corrupting magic sufficient to reach a change threshold frequently
     predisposes the next generation to be susceptible to either that type of
     magic, the type of emotions that are required for that magic, or both, by 10%
     _per ancestor_.  That is, the next generation might have *stronger concupiscence*
     and in fact *less free will.*
   - The thresholds involved for each kind of magic are very poorly researched
     and not at all understood.
   - As stated elsewhere, this effect lasts for four generations.
   - If the total effect exceeds 90% (at 100% you would have no free will), then
     the odds off something bizarre happening goes up by one percent for every
     10% of difference.
     * So if for example all of your progenitors on both sizes excessively used
       the killing curse, you would be susceptible to (unable to control) hatred
       (anger) by 300% base.  Since the total effect cannot remove your free
       will, the actual effect is more complicated.  Your great-grandparents
       each had a 20% boost (10% from each of their parents).  Your grandparents
       inherited that 20% boost *from both sides* and *in addition* a 10% boost
       because of each great-grandparent's own personal abuse of magic, yielding
       a 60% boost to your grandparent's experience of angry emotions, and a
       corresponding decrease in their ability to choose not to act on these
       emotions.  Your parents were the first generation to exceed 90%: a 60%
       remote inheritance, plus a 10% immediate inheritance, from each parent,
       for a total of 140%.  This is reduced to 90%, but the chance of something
       bizarre is increased by 5%.  You then get the 90% anger *and* the 5%
       bizarre factors as your remote inheritance, *plus* the 10% anger boost
       from *your parent's* personal abuse of magic (again from each parent).
       This puts your total anger boost at 180%, which is again reduced to 90%,
       but causes an additional boost on the chance of the bizarre, this time by
       9%.  This gets added to the 5% (per parent) from the remote inheritance,
       for a total chance of something bizarre happening to you at 19% over the
       base rate (5% from each parent plus 9% from 180 being 9*10 over 90).  One
       in five children in such a scenario would have something totally
       inexplicable happen to them magically, physically, or both as they are
       conceived, gestated and born.
     * Inbreeding would make the above worse, as some progenitors would be
       counted multiple times over.
     * Thus someone like Draco Malfoy actually does have tremendous trouble
       controlling his instinctual behaviour in many ways. Judged by human
       standards, he is mentally crippled, with severely damaged executive
       function, particularly in the areas of impulse control, aggression, and
       judgement.
1. Harry Potter talks about two classes that require special mention, squibs and
   muggle born.  They are effectively inverse of each other.
   * A true squib is the child who resulted from the 0.5% chance of becoming
     mundane.  Such a child is fully human, and no "muggle-born" will ever
     descend from such a child.
   * It is possible for a child receiving a partial inheritance from his or her
     parent(s) to have very low power.
     - A child with a power level of 2 or below on all categories will be called
       a squib.
     - A child with 3 or below on all categories will not be invited to any
       magical school, but might be able to effectively use some magic.  
       - A program like Kwick Spell might prey on such people.
       - Such a child might still be called a squib despite actually being able to use magic.
       Hogwarts requires at least a 4 in each of the following categories:
       Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; at least a 4 in *one* of Archangels or
       angels and at least a 3 in the other; and at least a 3 in each of
       Cherubim and Principalities.  However, a child who got in just barely
       meeting these minimums would be very unlikely to get into NEWT level
       classes.
   * Because it is possible (16% chance) for the parents' abilities to
     recombine, these "squibs" who are actually extremely low powered nephilim,
     can eventually produce higher powered children.  These children will
     *generally* be low powered (a mix of 3s, 4s and 5s in the various
     categories).  However, sometimes (base rate of a 1% chance) the something
     bizarre increases the child's ability beyond expectations.
   * This partially explains some of the bias against these "first generation"
     magical users.  Not only are they new to a xenophobic culture, but marrying
     them *generally* creates a risk of low powered children.  With this
     background, being of "pure" blood is basically ignoring the 19.5% chance of
     being under powered as compared to your parents. Illogical, but considering
     other human prejudices, not unreasonable.
   * Per my [base assumptions][AA], it is possible for
     a pure human to gain magic through the union with a fallen angel.  In
     practice, this has not happened in centuries, but magical society
     remembers adults suddenly having magic where none had been present before.
     From this comes stories of magic being "stolen."  This is not true of
     course, no one lost the magic the witch gained from her unholy union, but
     most magic users do not believe in angels, much less fallen angels, and
     have a strong distrust for the Church.

### Specifically human/nephil

* "Standard" nephilim seem more or less humans with extra abilities, but this is
  not really true. If you consider creation as a hierarchy, humanity has always
  occupied a messy place - top of the material creation, bottom of the spiritual
  order, but destined, through grace, not merit, to be raised above its (our)
  natural place.  Introducing the nephilim in this fictional world, I am putting
  the nephilim as being an unnatural hybrid of two things God created. In making
  this hybrid, something of each was lost. They are thus *slightly* lesser than
  humans, and *entirely* outside the intended, natural hierarchy. Despite
  having greater capabilities in some ways, they have deficits in others, most
  notably, they are overall *less free.*  Think of mules, they have advantages,
  in certain circumstances, over both donkeys and horses, but they are not
  really a stable species at all, and in some ways (specifically fertility)
  less than either.

  In angelic beings, there is very little potentiality in knowledge, when they
  learn something, they learn it fully and completely, not gradually come to
  understand/know it over time.  As part and parcel of this, when an angelic
  being decides, its decision lasts for all time, and is by nature irrevocable.
  Thus we say that free will for angelic beings consists, in some ways, of the
  sole choice to obey God or to rebel against God, made once at the moment of
  their creation. This is not precisely accurate, but is a reasonable working
  definition.  Humans on the other hand, learn and grow over time, constantly
  changing.  Thus our choices are contingent on our level of knowledge and
  experience, and since that is, as I stated, always changing, our choices are
  not irrevocable until the moment of death.  We can repent of past actions, and
  through grace even repair our relationship with God.

  Nephil have some aspects of both.  They are *mostly* contingent beings that
  grow and change over time, but their use of magic is, in this universe, the
  use of an angelic power, and so it tends to either be 1) incredibly crippled
  compared to actual angels (for example, charms wear off really fast) or 2)
  incredibly permanent. In the canon books, you cannot remove Walburga's
  portrait from the wall without removing the wall, which might have been stupid
  for a house that will be passed down through generations, but clearly
  demonstrates that a momentary decision can have effects all out of proportion
  to the result.  I am restricting that to magic used on things without immortal
  souls and to magic used on *other nephilim* (or on races descending from
  nephilim, see below).  Things that would be temptations to a human can be
  overriding compulsions to a nephil, and they are vulnerable to each other (and
  to others who can use similar powers) in ways that humans are not.  See the
  notes on [contracts].
* At some point in history, each nephil descends from a witch.  This witch had
  magic of only one type, that of the angel that seduced her.  The nephil
  inherited *only that type* of magic, and is called a "primordial" nephil.
* Per the above, in practice, most modern nephil have mixed inheritances, and
  thus magic in a broad range of categories.
* nephil do get one straight up advantage over humans in addition to using
  magic - they [live longer][AE].  This is *actually* a side effect of their 
  magic, which, regardless of type, will offer some protection against disease 
  and against the effects of entropy (and thus old age).  It does not halt 
  the decay of old age, but it does retard it.  The extent to which it 
  extends the nephil's life depends on the nephil's *average* (not highest) 
  power level (only including power levels where present at all).  
* Per earlier sections, it takes approximately six consecutive generations of magical
  abuse for "truly bizarre" things to become not just possible but probable.
   * Recall the note from [Appendix A][AA] on _The
     Screwtape Letters_.
   * Building on what I wrote above comparing "standard humans" to nephil,
     beings in these categories are even more corrupted by the combination of
     sin and the inherent weakness of being of a race that was made, and not
     created. For lack of of a better word, they are more nearly animals, they
     *do* have immortal souls, but, to differing degrees (depending on species)
     lack even more of the free will that is already impaired in the nephilim.
     This list is essentially ordered from most nearly equal to the nephilim to
     least nearly equal.
   * mermen - These were once a magically powerful people who used inheritances
     from the Dominions to transmute themselves to survive [the great Flood].
   * dwarfs - I really dislike what Mrs. Rowling did with the dwarfs in _the
     Chamber of Secrets_.[^210518-1]  Since she says that goblins of all
     things are expert craftsmen,[^210518-2] my take is that nephil became
     dwarfs which in turn became goblins.  I will figure out something else for
     Lockhart's cupids if I ever get that far in writing.
   * goblins - people, descendant from the dwarfs, who are highly susceptible to
     greed, envy, and wrath.  Their form has been distorted by the sins of their
     forefathers centuries ago.  Once, they would have ranked in this list below
     the veela.  However, they are still capable of good deeds, and some have
     been so highly virtuous as to have actually reduced their susceptibility
     from the 90% maximum to a more manageable 60-70%.  Similarly, the physical
     changes wrought on them have "softened" and so they are less hideous than
     described by authors like Tolkien who have packaged aspects of the magical
     world as fiction.  Despite their flaws, these populations retained their
     intelligence and their magic.  They are particularly strong inheritors from
     the Virtues, Powers, and Archangels, with lesser inheritances from the
     Principalities and angels.  Their creation of the trolls at the beginning of
     the [goblin wars] explains why they were punished so harshly (as to have 
     originally lost nearly all free will - 90% impact).
   * hags - a people who are consumed by envy and lust.  They have particularly
     strong inheritances from the Thrones, reasonable inheritances from the
     Virtues and Powers.  Some have partial inheritances of random other types.
     Hags are known for using infant sacrifice in evil magical rites.  These
     sins robbed their ancestors of all they can now value.
   * centaurs - a nearly primordial people (inheriting from both the the
     Seraphim and Cherubim) who, not just as individuals, but as a people,
     selfishly abused divination magic until something truly bizarre happened.
     - Their form transmuted to a half animal form to reflect the fact that
       their free will is nearly gone.  They now have a herd instinct that rules
       much of their behaviour.
     - They became nearly immune to the magic of the Thrones as practised by
       other mortals.  It is next to impossible to confound or imperious a
       centaur for example.  This is in part because they perceive the magic of
	   the attempt.  This is a mitigation of their curse, which happened
	   because while divination is evil, their *intentions* were not, and their
	   *understanding* of their act flawed.
     - While it is, per the above, almost impossible to affect individuals with
       magical effects on the mind or free will, the *herd* is massively
       influenced at a subconscious level by the moral state of the people in
       surrounding areas.  Whenever the societies around them take a turn for
       the worse, so do they; whenever the societies they live near turn towards
       God, the centaur populations become more friendly.
     - they remain addicted to divination, as such they perpetuate these effects
       to the next generation endlessly.
     - the ranking in this list between centaur and veela is debatable.  Any
       single centaur is probably less free than any single veela, but as a
       herd, centaurs are capable of slightly more autonomy than pure veela are
       either as individuals or in groups (since veela have no herd, or in their
       case flock, effect).
   * veela - For the purposes of this story, veela are "dark"
     creatures[^210126-4].  I have chosen to create a version of veela that
	 justifies the suspicion that [Molly], [Hermione][] and [Ginny][] view 
     [Fleur][] with.  Veela have some of the strongest inheritances from the 
     Thrones of all humanoid magic users.  The pure veela is not an example of 
     a primordial people.  Rather, the veela race comes from an example of
	 true perfidy.  The first veela was a child whose maternal grandmother was
	 a Thrones witch, and whose paternal grandparents were primordial nephilim
	 of the Dominions and Powers types.  This child grew up into a young woman
	 who viewed the men around her as easily manipulated means to her ends.
	 She used her abilities to inflame their desires and bind their wills, with
     little regard for not only the men, but also the impact on the families
     they came from.  She was also responsible for the creation of doxies and
     fairies.  Her crimes, particularly the creation of humaniform creatures,
     were so great that she was cursed with a Screwtape style mutation of epic
     proportions:
     - All veela are female, a male child of a veela will inherit solely from
       the child's father in terms of magic.  This is a control placed on the 
       punishment to ensure it does not itself become an uncontrolled problem. 
     - A "half-veela" is a veela/nephil cross where either the veela nature was,
       against the odds, only partially inherited; or the 16% chance that the
       veela nature is inherited in addition to a full nephil inheritance.  All
       half-veela are female.
     - Her concupiscence was vastly increased. A full veela has perhaps 20% of
       the ability to go against her instincts that a full human does.  A
       half-veela will generally have much more free will, divine providence
       generally ensures that a being that is not bound by the limits here
       described for full veela inherits her father's self control.
     - Her form was changed to shift to that of a bird's any time her wrath,
       sloth, greed, or gluttony exceed her (incredibly minimal) control over
       them.  What type of bird she most resembles seems to vary from veela
       community to veela community.  This almost always applies to half-veela
       as well.
     - Her inheritance from the Dominions was restricted (leading some scholars
       to mistakenly think that veela are descendent from a primordial population) 
       * in human form she *always* produces a super-abundance of pheromones.  
         She cannot *not* produce them, though with considerable effort she can 
         control *how much* she produces.  This is true of half-veela as well.
       * in avian form, she can *only* produce a form of naphtha that catches
         fire instantly when exposed to oxygen, though fortunately (for
         everyone else) she has *some* control over this (unlike the
         pheromones).
       * Per above, extreme lack of repentance for her behaviour caused many of
         her vices, such as her temper, to get locked in place as a perpetual
         temptation for her, and her decedents, to fight hopelessly against.
         Remember, nephilim are more like angels in that their choices can have
         permanent repercussions.
       * she can transmute herself between forms, but unlike an animagus, her
         shift is not under direct conscious control, but is rather tied to her
         (incredibly limited) ability to control herself.  Some full veela spend
         nearly their entire lives as a bird.  This is also true of half-veela,
         though they *tend* to have greater control over their temper, and thus
         tend to spend much more time in human form.  In a sense, the full veela
         is becoming an animal.  Had that process completed, if any veela ever
         did live her entire life as a bird, it is doubtful that her descendants
         would have an immortal soul at all.  
     - Her inheritance from the Powers was restricted such that it *cannot*
       combine with her inheritance from the Dominions.  No full veela is
       capable of permanent transmutation, and a "half-veela" is capable of it
       only to the extent her male parent was.
     - Her lifespan was reduced to half that of a full human's.[^210916-1]
       A half-veela has a 16% chance of inheriting the greater of the two
       lifespans (her father's and her mother's), a 14% chance of inheriting the
       average of the two lifespans, and a 70% chance of simply being either
       veela (with a veela's lifespan) or not being veela (with the lifespan of
       whatever her father is, either a nephil or a human or whatever).
     - Her fertility was shifted such her body is sufficiently actively hostile
       to male sperm that female births outnumber male births by at least three
       to one.  This is generally true of half-veela as well.
     - Her physical maturation is human like from age zero to the onset of
       puberty, but then becomes more rapid like that of a bird's until she
       reaches full physical maturity.  How fast this is depends on which veela
       community she comes from.  This is generally proportionately true of a
       half-veela (average normal human growth with that typical of her veela
       community).
     - While all veela come from a single common ancestor, further _Screwtape_
       style mutations have resulted in some differences between different
       communities.
       * More eagle-like veela are found primarily in Western Europe, particularly in France and Spain.  They generally finish maturing by thirteen.  
       * More hawk-like veela are found primarily in eastern Europe, particularly in Bulgaria and Roumania.  They will rapidly mature over the course of a few days.  
     - Her *mental* maturation is not accelerated during this time of
       accelerated physical growth, putting a mentally young girl in an adult's
       body for a period of years (with all the extra self control issues
       adding adult hormone levels to that lack of mental maturity would
       imply).  This is why [Fleur]'s classmates dislike her so much - people
       tend to expect someone who appears older to behave older.  They remember 
       the brat. 
     - If a veela falls in love, her pheromone ability inverts, instead of
       producing pheromones that bewitch others, she produces pheromones that
       perfectly mimic those produced by the person she has fallen in love with.
       Combined with her weakened will power (see above), she is very poorly
       equipped to control the production of these pheromones, causing her own
       magic to essentially enslave her to the one she loves. This remains true
       of the "half-veela."[^210916-2]  This is the punishment for giving in
       to the temptation of her locked powers.
     - *ALL* veela are female, despite the normal rules, only female children
       *ever* inherit veela powers or the physical and mental changes that now
       go with them.  It is *possible* though per the above *unlikely* that a
       veela will have a male child.  The child will *always* inherit either in
       a purely human fashion or *solely* from the father.  This is equally
       true of half-veela.  A veela's child does not get its inheritance per-trait as is normal.
     - The veela are harshly punished, but the transformation is also a warning,
       both for them, and for all able to use magic.  That this punishment
       actually *be* a warning, the angels acting to punish the veela also
       ensured that the reasons (creation of humaniform animals) for the especial
       harshness of this punishment where revealed to every nephilim community.  
       At one point this was common knowledge, but the nephilim are remarkably
       good at ignoring things they do not want to know.  See [Appendix G][AG] on
       Original Sin.
   * giants - the physical changes wrought on them by sin have become "mundane"
     and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  Church [records][Giants] 
     show that the giants come from the creators of the house elves. Behold in 
     them what man would be if left without his mind, the only hope they have 
     is that their intellects are so clouded that it is nearly impossible for 
     them to actually commit a mortal sin.  Should any be willing to be 
     missionary to the giants, the grace of baptism would be nearly unopposed, 
     because these beings have so little ability to freely choose to do 
     anything, and even less ability to understand something is gravely wrong.

    I have not copied it precisely as he came up with it, my version is
    less voluntary, and does not include the death inducing madness, nor the bond
    aspect.

### Other Races

Other "races" are not really people at all, they have varying levels of
intelligence, but are all effectively the same as meeting different qualities of
AI players, as if you were encountering cyborgs.

The creation of these "races" is an abomination, and the more nearly human, or
in other words the more perfectly they simulate free will, the greater the
abomination.  This will definitely have had *Screwtape* style bizarre effects
on the perpetrators of these crimes against creation and their descendants.
This is true because of the moral confusion it causes - these "races" do not
have immortal souls the way humans, angels, nephil, or the nephil descended
races do, and yet they appear as if they should.  It is true because their
creation mocks the creation of man.  And lastly, it is true because their
creation, particularly that of the house elves and the trolls, has created
groups that exist at odds with true charity: in the case of the trolls a "race"
that cannot rise above rage, and in the case of the house elves a "race" that
can never be fully freed.

* Acromantula - created from spiders (obviously) by an unknown nephil or group
  of nephilim.  Acromantula are capable of learning human speech, but do not
  speak anything that could be defined as a language in the wild.[^210916-3]
* Bowtruckle - created by the extreme use of magics on tree branches by an
  unknown agency (may be directly demonic).
* fairies/imps/doxies - created by the extreme use of magics on (different)
  insects, these beings appear humanoid, but still reproduce by laying eggs like
  insects.  Unlike gnomes, they have some ability to form long term memories,
  but only very limited ability to learn from these experiences; their actions
  are guided by incredibly strong instinct rather than by reasoning. They are
  very like domesticated cats and dogs in this respect; a dog might remember its
  owner, but its behaviours will always be more governed by instinct than not.
  It is known that, in addition to her crimes of enslavement, fairies and
  doxies were created by the woman who became the first veela.  It is unknown
  who first created imps.
* ghoul - unknown origin. Often treated as a pet.[^210916-4]
* gnomes - created by the extreme use of magics on clay figures, these beings
  have no long term memory at all.  It is unknown who created these.
* house elves - created by the extreme use of magics on an unknown mammal (not a
  human), they are the most nearly human of all created beings.  They are
  capable of learning, loyalty and betrayal; they have memories equivalent to
  ours.  They closely mimic having true free will, just as some human scientists
  speculate the highest animals do.  When bound, and elf can "feed" on the bond,
  using its master's magic to amplify its own.  This stronger magic also slows
  the elf's ageing process.  Any bond at all will slow an elf's ageing by a factor
  of 2 (age half a year for each year you live).  If the elf feels itself to be
  *part of the family*, the bond can slow ageing by an additional factor of 2
  (each year ages you a quarter of a year).  If the elf feels its contribution
  is *critical*, then, independent of the feeling of family, (but not
  independent of being bound) the elf can gain a factor of 2.  If the elf feels
  that it is *fully utilised* (kept free from idleness), it gains a factor of
  *4*.  Where a human gets stressed by being overworked, an elf actually gets
  *healthier* if it cannot complete the work necessary.  However, not just any
  work will have this life extending effect, only *disinterested* work does.
  That is, only work done for work's sake, or work done altruistically has the
  life-extending effect.  These effects, including the limitation on types of
  work, was (cruelly) built into them to ensure that elves would remain loyal.

  The effects of the bond have, by and large, had the desired effect.  Since the
  elf's base average lifespan is only twenty years, being unbound is a huge
  thing for elves.  Elves have grown/matured enough to start working by age
  three, and reach full physical and mental maturity around age five, which is
  the earliest they can be bound.  They were created by the ancestors of the
  giants, before they lost their magic, but after they had already grown large
  enough to need helpers with more nimble fingers.
  - a bound elf (1/2) who feels him/her self part of the family (divide by 2
    again), is critical to the family's welbeing (another 1/2 on top), and is
    fully utilised (1/4) would thus age at a rate of 1/32nd normal.  In other
    words they would live to on average 485 years old instead of 20 years (5
    years ageing at a normal rate before being bound, added to 15*32).
  - from this we can conclude that Dobby would be, in human terms, considered
    very nearly suicidal in his desire for freedom.  He was bound (factor of
    2), and fully utilised (factor of 4 on top of that), but neither part of
    the family nor critical. He thus, prior to being freed, aged at a rate of
    1/16 normal (out of a possible 1/32th).  
* Leprechaun - created by the use of extreme magics on an unknown mammal, by an
  unknown being.
  > More intelligent than the fairy and less malicious than the imp, the pixie
  > or the Doxy, the leprechaun is nevertheless mischievous.[^210916-5]
* Pixie - The pixie largely resembles an imp in behaviour and intelligence, but
  the fact that it bears live young suggests a different origin.  We have no
  true history of how they came to be.
* Red Cap - even less intelligent than trolls, it is suspected that like them
  they were originally created for some type of combat.  That being said, no
  real knowledge of their origin is known.
* Sphinx - created by the extreme use of magic on a lion by an Egyptian nephil,
  the only true unknown is how the sphinx survived the great Flood.  We are
  fairly confident, mostly by process of elimination, that its creators did not.
* trolls - created by the extreme use of magics on apes, the *most* intelligent
  trolls might be able to perform similarly to a human with mental retardation
  capable of living in a group home. This is not a fair comparison however, the
  human is suffering from a disability; the troll is performing with unusual
  *capability.*  Believed to be created by the ancestors of the goblins.
