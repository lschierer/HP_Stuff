## historical origin of the nephilim

This section is pure AU fiction unique to this work.

For my purposes, remember that per [Appendix A][AA] a nephil is a descendant of the union
of a human and a fallen angel.  What was the angel's motives in this?  I am of course
building off of the more supernatural interpretation of the concept of nephilim that
some biblical scholars have proposed.[^230714-1]  But remember, we are also building off
of _[Many Waters][MW]_.  So, with those thoughts in mind, let's build a story around
this.

The basic premise is that the fallen angels wanted to mock God.  They are unable to
create from nothing as God does, so they are limited in what they can do.  They
take themselves, and they take humanity as their 'base material' and *make* (not
*create*) something of this 'material' but call the result their 'creation'.

* They are mocking God in that they have created something visually indistinguishable
  from man, the centrepiece of His creation.
* They are mocking God in that by giving their 'creation' some of their own abilities
  and powers, they claim to have created something superior to God's creation.  As we
  have seen, they failed: the nephilim have less free will than either humanity or
  angels because their being contains some of the limitations of each. They retain
  some of the inability to change that an angel has, residing at once in a being that
  is susceptible *to* change.
* They are mocking God by mocking marriage, in which humanity in a symbolic way
  mirrors the inner life of the Trinity, and thus God himself.  See below in the
  Marriage and debt sections for details. Here they fail only in part.  They do
  succeed in creating a being that, because it can be forced into relationship,
  can only conditionally give self to self.  The Nephilim struggle to make a total,
  free, faithful, and fruitful gift of self.  It is possible for magic to be used on
  them, or even accidentally by them, in ways that would violate any or all of these
  conditions.  However the unfallen angels did not simply sit back and allow this to
  happen entirely unchallenged.
* The fallen angels desired to make their mockery still more complete.  Unfallen angels
  intervened at various times and ways.  Sometimes not to do so would create something 
  that *must not be*, sometimes to punish some or all nephilim, sometimes to fix what 
  in retrospect was a mistake when they intervened in the past. Recall that per my [rules][AA]
  for this universe, an angel can make a well-intentioned mistake. 
    * that ensure the restrictions on [magical contracts][AF] exist.
    * that the angelic nature's tendency to the absolute and the permanent does not prevent
      the nephilim, who exist within time, from experiencing free will.
    * that the abuse of the angelic power comes with equally magical consequences
        * See my notes below on on Free Will, angels do not always act wisely here however well-intentioned.
        * Angels have had to intervene to correct their own mistakes (not sins, honest mistakes)
    * that these consequences tend to self limit abuses across generations
        * so that free will is preserved
        * so that justice is served
        * so that redemption is both possible and desirable to each generation
    * many other ways that frequently *appear* arbitrary and/or capricious - see again that point about not always being wise.

Modern nephilim are the result of very mixed heritage, and thus have a wide variety
of the powers defined in [Appendix B][AB].  *In a first generation nephil, that is not
so.*  Such a nephil has powers stemming from only one kind of angel.  Thus (for example)
'contracts' can affect these nephilim in only very narrow ways.  The fallen angels, being angels,
perfectly understand future implications of present states.  The hybrid nephilim are
in fact the intended mockery, the first generation ones were and are a means to that end.

## Characteristics of the Nephilim

As a distortion of God's creation, nephilim do not, cannot fit cleanly into 
either creation or Divine Law. [Soteriology][WP1], [Missiology][WP2], and 
[Ecclesiology][WP3] get interesting (and fictional) curlicues and footnotes 
trying to deal with the chaotic fallout of the interaction between the 
angelic and the human in a nephil's nature.  This lets me do things to/with 
the characters that would not otherwise be at all moral.  Some of this is
covered in [Appendix G][AG].

The reader might understand the nephilim by somewhat comparing them to mules or 
[ligers].  While in some ways they may appear to have advantages to one or both 
parent species, they are an artificial, unnatural 'creation'.   Just as a 
hippogriff is impossible by normal genetics, and cannot be explained by Mendelian 
inheritance patterns, children of either two nephil or one human and one nephil 
do not follow purely Mendelian inheritance patterns.  This is explained in detail
in [Appendix C][AC].

### Animagi 

In _[Many Waters][MW]_, all angels have an animal form with which they monitor and
sometimes interact with humanity.  This dual form is one of the things that the 
nephilim inherit from their (fallen) angelic parents.  All nephil are animagi.  
However, normally a child, growing up around those who either do not have or do 
not use this power, begins to instinctively suppress the ability. This suppression 
thing is how I am merging the Harry Potter concept with the _[Many Waters][MW]_ 
concept, and is thus found in neither original work.  Some traditions, like that 
described in _Short Stories of Heroism_ are time consuming, difficult, and 
exacting.[^220628-1]  In this work this is not because of the inherent difficulty 
of the actual magic, but rather the drawn out ritual is, functionally but 
unknowingly to the nephilim population (who largely have not studied any actual 
psychology), training the nephil to *allow* the change, to overcome the 
enculturated inhibitions against using this power.  Moreover, Magic is in part 
about belief, you cannot do something you believe you cannot do.  Thus if you 
believe that the transformation is difficult, you can (unconsciously) *make it 
difficult.*   This last (making magic difficult) applies to more than just
animagi. 

Uagadou is known for teaching self transfiguration.[^220628-2]  Their results 
differ from the way most nephil communities handle the animagi ability.  Rather 
than working with the student's innate form, the Uagadou school teaches 
students to mutate themselves, and thus to *change* their innate form.  They 
disregard the repercussions this has on the student's core personality, and 
sometimes even on the person's ability to function in normal human society.

### Free Will 

As stated in my [rules][AA], I believe that Mrs. Rowling set up a universe in 
which binding magical contracts can be forced on someone in at least some
circumstances.  I expound at some length on the topic in [Appendix F][AF].

More widely, we have two different kinds of beings with two different modes of
exercising knowledge, and will.  Angels were created and exist outside of time.
At the moment of their creation, in some manner we lack the capacity to fully
understand, they have a single moment of choice, as they grasp all they will
ever know, and understand that knowledge as completely as they will ever do so.
They choose, quite simply, to obey God, or to rebel.  My _[Many Waters][MW]_
infusion confuses this angelic nature somewhat, in that she depicts angels as 
manifestly confused, fumbling, and making well-intentioned mistakes.  Her angels
appear to exist in time.  I am trying to rectify her mistake slightly.  My angels
*do* make mistakes, but these mistakes happen outside of time, and so get rectified,
if they are rectified at all, not by an angel learning, but by a different angel
acting to different circumstances with a different understanding that is equally
static. 

Humans in contrast are constantly learning and changing.  For them an act of the
will is contingent on their knowledge and understanding at the time, and as he/she
grows as a person, he/she can come to repent of his/her decision, and change 
his/her mind.  Thus the final disposition of the person's salvation is not and
cannot be known until death brings with it both judgement and sufficient revelation
of God's nature that the particular human is capable of gaining no greater 
understanding, and thus of no future change.

How do we unite these two things into our fictional nephil?  The attempt to do so,
I posit, results in something less than either.  The nephilim exist in time,
as do humans.  As such they grow and change, but their innermost nature inclines
them to the absolute, fixed, and unchanging in a way that not even the most 
stubborn of human's does.  It is easier for a nephil to learn, but it is much
harder for the nephil to break *either* a vice or a virtue, or even unlearn a
"fact" that is later proven to be unfactual.  A human can realize he/she was
taught incorrectly, a nephil actually struggles with this. 

Thus it is not actually Hermione's fault that she trusts books too much, nor 
Draco's fault that he cannot see past his parent's bigotry.  These are rather
aspects of the fact that they are *not human*.  This, combined with their
greater average lifespan, also explains the inherent and relatively extreme
conservatism of nephilim society.  They are simply not capable of the rapid 
change that humanity experiences at the rate humanity experiences it. 

### Physical Nature

This union also has implications on the physical form of the nephilim.  Here
I am relying rather more on _[The Screwtape Letters][TSL2]_ than on _[Many 
Waters][MW]_, though some is coming from both.  C. S. Lewis describes his
character as being transformed by his rage into a being that resembles a giant
catepillar; his secretary takes writing each letter for the remainder of the
book.  L’Engle has angels able to have marital intercourse with humanity, and
as I said, I have chosen the biblical interpretation that they have actual
offspring.  

Taken together, I posit that the nephilim would be more resistant to a the type
of total change that C. S. Lewis' main character experiences.  They would not,
however, be entirely immune to changes that would make them less human.  Unlike
an angel, they can repent from sin, so they can *also* experience changes that
remediate the effects of prior changes, either in themselves or in their
forefathers.  I do, in fact posit that these changes would be inheritable, just
as Original Sin is inheritable.  



To play with Mark Twain's words, to the extent that there is any moral to this,
it is to show what could happen if a whole series of really bad choices were 
made.  When the only choices the characters see are between bad and worse.
