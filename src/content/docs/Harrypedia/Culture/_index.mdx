This is the place where Rowling's excuse for world building falls down most.
From my perspective, she cannot seem to decide if she wants to actually build a
hidden society living in parallel with the non-magical one, or if she is making
magical families different simply as an excuse for humor.  If the former, then
some of the more ludicrous elements she has introduced are flaws in the design.
If the latter, then the massive amount of backstory that she *has* provided in
her various website articles is superfluous, unnecessary, and frankly a waste
of time.  If you want to write a farce, do so.  If you want to engage in some
world building to satisfy those, like myself, who want more detail, then take
us seriously.
