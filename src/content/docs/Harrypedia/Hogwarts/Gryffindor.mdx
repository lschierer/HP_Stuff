### Myths

* Values:
  * Loyalty[^221221-2].  I suspect this comes from an imperfect understanding
    of chivalry, "courage, honour, courtesy, justice, and a readiness to help
    the weak."  And certainly to be disloyal may show a lack of honour.
    However, in the context of the overall list, and contrasted with
    [Hufflepuff][], it is clear that loyalty is not the defining factor of this
    house.
