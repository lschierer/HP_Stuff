[^20210603-2]: I know the popular theory is to white-wash the druids, but I
    refuse to do so.  Mr. James Owen's "[Druids Committed Human Sacrifice,
    Cannibalism?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/druids-sacrifice-cannibalism)"
    [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) 2009-03-20. This
    article may provide only one example, but to me there is no real reason to
    dismiss Caesar and Pliny the Elder's testimony to begin with, so having a
    confirming piece of evidence like this really just makes the whole thing
    rather irrefutable.
