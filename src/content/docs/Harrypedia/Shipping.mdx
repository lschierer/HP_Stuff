### Overview

I think that nearly all writers fall into one of a very few categories when
dealing with Harry.

* There are the "Lets see what sort of twisted torture we can put him/her
  through" group out there.  They come up with bizarre situations and
  pairings mostly just because they want to see the characters suffer.
* There are a ton of people who really wanted Harry to end up with [Hermione].
  Some of these are simply lazy; [Hermione] is the only female with true
  character development in the series.  Some of these identify with
  [her][Hermione], and so the pairing is essentially wish fulfilment.
* There are people who write [Harry]/[Draco] or similar stories.  Some
  of these are reacting to Mrs. Rowling's unpopular opinions.  Some
  of these are doing the wish fulfilment thing - they have these types
  of attraction, and so need Harry to have them also.  Some of them are
  doing the "lets torture the characters" thing, and really belong in
  the first category.
* The writers that pair [Harry] with [Fleur], or [Nymphadora] are
  essentially the same as the ones that write harem stories.
* Harem stories vary in sophistication from pure smut to something that
  can be surprisingly worth reading, but nearly every case there is that
  underlying immaturity.  In all these cases, they are setting [Harry]
  up for a situation that is fundamentally unrealistic because they are
  not really dealing with real girls. Perhaps the author is doing that
  *because* these are fictional characters, and so this is a safe
  outlet for something the author knows full well is *not real.*  Perhaps
  it is because the author is *actually immature.*  Sometimes as a
  reader you can tell, other times only the author could truly say which.

This is not only fiction, but fan fiction.  It is *really really* hard
to resist the temptation to explore the holes in Mrs. Rowling's world
building.  As part of that, it is *really really* hard not to put the
characters in totally unrealistic and impossible interpersonal
situations, because these situations allow me to explore some of the
interesting holes.  Things like [contracts], [veela], [life debts], and
even to some extent the [trace] are hard to fully play with unless you
deal with adult situations.

I do try to be *somewhat* reasonable with my treatment of the characters.
While there are enjoyable aspects of _[For Want of an Outfit]_, it has an
acceptance of kinkiness that, I think, distorts the characters too much.
That said, I do cause things to happen that are only remotely possible
because Mrs. Rowling has introduced, bluntly, magic, without fully
defining or confining it.  I am certainly not going to twist an
established character's personality just to introduce a political
statement into a story.  Any "alternative universe" story allows for
changing the characters to fit the new universe, but I believe they
should still be recognisably themselves.
