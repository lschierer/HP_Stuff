The British Ministry of Magic classifies things as "Beings", "[Non-Beings],"
"[Animals]" (magical and non-magical), and "[Vegitation]"
(magical and non-magical).[^211111-2]  This last is really an implicet
category, as most wizards think the difference between vegitation and
non-vegitation much more clear than a non-magical scientist would.[^211111-1]

While there are some political considerations in who is officially granted this
status in the magical world, I am going to classify based on sentience.  While
this is somewhat murky, as it is possible to have both different kinds of
inteligence and different possible ranges of inteligence and yet still be
sentient, it is the *right* definition.
