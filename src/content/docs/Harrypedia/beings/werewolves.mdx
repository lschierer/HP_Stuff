Can a non-magical person get infected? If so, can they then use magic? 
I have seen speculation that a non-magical person infected would die on the
first change,[^210513-4] and speculation that *most* werewolves are
non-magical.[^210513-5]

Overall, Werewolf-ism is a virus, it *might* cross the placental wall, but it
would not be inherited from father to child.  It does seem clear that this virus
shortens the person's lifespan noticeably. 

Is the werewolf more or less susceptible to [Legilimency][]?  Does the virus
create a "wolf" personality in his/her mind?  Would fracturing your mind that
way make it harder to attack, or harder to defend?

Does the werewolf experience physical changes that persist the rest of the time?
Enhanced sense of smell, or strength? 

Exactly how "full" does the moon need to be for a werewolf to turn? Is it
precisely one night a month, or several? 

Can the werewolf change at will, or only involuntarily? 

The moon is up during the day sometimes.  How would a solar eclipse affect a
werewolf?
