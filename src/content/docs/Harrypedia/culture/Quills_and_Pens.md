## Quills

The use of quills for writing is another seemingly deliberately antiquated choice 
made by the wizarding world.  While the quill would be a common writing instrument
in non-magical Europe until the early 1800s,[^200816-5] they were the *common* 
writing utensil, whereas the wizarding world seems to have particularly chosen the
more exclusive [parchment] as its writing surface.  

Some writers have speculated that the reason for the sustained use of the quill
may be magical in nature.  That the quill may channel the writer's magic in some
way that matters when writing on magical topics.[^231004-1]  If this is true,
then the magical population of China, Japan, and similar cultures where writing 
with brushes is common must have precise and magical requirements for the nature
of the brushes used when writing on these topics.  This is not impossible, as the
traditional brushes used are *usually* made of bamboo with natural fibers, 
generally animals' hair, for the bristles.[^231004-2]  

The counter argument is the lack of variety.  Matching a user to a wand requires
a range of wood types and at least 3 types of core materials to embed within that
wood.[^231004-3]

## Dip Pens

For whatever reason, it occurred to me to look up the steel nibbed dip pens that
predated fountain pens, wondering when in non-magical (actual) history pens
started to replace the use of quills.  I was really quite surprised.  Apparently
pens go *way* back, the Wikipedia [article][Dip pen] was very Britain centric
(which is actually fine for my purposes), but apparently our earliest pen (a
copper one) dates from around 410, just as the Romans were pulling out of
Britain.[^200816-4] It does not come out and state it, but my guess is that for
a long time fine metal work was *really* expensive, so quills remain the
standard writing utensil until the mass production of steel pens in
1822.[^200816-5]  Interestingly, according to the article, these type of pens
are still favoured over fountain pens for calligraphy and other artistic works
that require precision and varied thicknesses.[^200816-6]

From this I can draw a couple of conclusions.  Magical users would dislike
fountain pens, because they seem drawn to multi-coloured inks (which are more
difficult with fountain pens), and because arts like ancient runes would need
much the same precision that writing calligraphy does.  The dip pen on the other
hand, should show no marked difference from a quill for writing your runes.
Both would be substandard to a brush - there is a reason that Chinese and
Japanese languages are painted, not written when you look at the really fancy
stuff. The dip pen could further be *engraved* with runes.  In the books you see
spell correcting quills, and others with anti-cheating charms.  I can see both
of these being done more reliably with runes.  You want a dicto-quill?  Again,
you can see how this can be reproduced.

Moreover, magical users are clearly drawn to the aesthetic quality of a fancy
feather.  Fountain pens *can* be artistic, but are generally fairly utilitarian.
Your dip pen on the other hand could be a work of art.  I did a quick Google
search on "steel nib feather" for example, and you can just imagine a wizard
using many of those.

## Paper

Paper and parchment is a bit more uncertain.  Paper is *really* old, perhaps as
far back as 300 B.C. in China.[^200816-7]  However, it took a while for paper
to reach Europe, sometime around the 11th Century.[^200816-8]  Paper was
originally viewed with disdain, unworthy for formal communication, or important
works[^200816-9]; something that would definitely influence the magically
community.  However, it seems that by the 16th Century or so, paper had largely
replaced parchment, driven largely by the printing press.[^200816-10] The
Wizarding world does seem to have a sufficient trade in books to stock at least
two book stores (one in Hogsmeade and one in Diagon Alley), and I am quite
confident that the books give us a view of the press that the Quibbler is
printed on.  This means that they do use paper books, and paper periodicals.

Any number of fanfiction works I've read have speculated that there might be a
magical reason for using parchment instead of paper.  Most of these have not
really made much sense given the above.  However one I came across recently
does.

> Paper doesn’t take magic terribly well: parchment is a single piece of
animal skin, a unitary object. Paper is laid fibre from multiple trees, a
composite object and as such tricky to get predictable results out of when you
enchant it. The more you know, et cetera.[^200819-1]

The reference is to some of the fragmentary descriptions we have from
[McGonagall]'s lectures on transfiguration.  You have to be able to visualise
the object that you are working your magic on.  In this light it is actually
easier to see why it might be troublesome to enchant paper.  It would be all
too easy to have a charm take hold on only a subset of the fibres involved, and
thus behave erratically across the document.  This makes a strong argument for
using parchment (or vellum) for documents that are *actually magical in nature*
(like contracts, tests charmed against cheating, official government or banking
forms, etc), but not for standard every day things (like homework, class notes,
and letters (unless you are including privacy charms)).

## The Right Tools

You would then want writing utensils that work equally well on both, but while
I can't speak to how a fountain pen or ball point pen might work on parchment, a
quill or dip pen should both work equally well on any decent quality paper.  While
at least one author has solved this by saying that magic is disrupted by the
inorganic materials in pens, but flows into one's writing when using a quill,[^230804]
there is no canonical basis for this line of thought; it is pure speculation.
