Mrs. Rowling's canonical Harry Potter books are entirely secular.  They *do*
mention a Christmas break, but only in the Christmas feast and Christmas
presents sense.  In other words, even less than the secular world since she
omits any reference to Santa.  This is acceptable in a children's book aimed at
broad appeal, but leaves us with a glaring hole in understanding the people she
is depicting.

A number of fan fiction writers have speculated that the magical population
would have their own religion, often heavily influenced by the writer's
(generally superficial) understanding of Celtic druids.[^220715-1]  Generally
this is accompanied as a partial justification for pure-blood bigotry.

Where that is true, it falls down utterly.  None of the first generation
magical students agreed to convert religions as a prerequisite of learning to
use an innate talent.  Nor did their parents agree on their behalf.  This
argument that they should practice the "magical religion" and/or "magical
holidays" immediately triggers the immigration argument.
