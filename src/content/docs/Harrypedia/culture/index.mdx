title: "Wizarding World Culture"

This is the place where Rowling's excuse for world building falls down
most. From my perspective, she cannot seem to decide if she wants to
actually build a hidden society living in parallel with the non-magical
one, or if she is making magical families different simply as an excuse
for humor.  If the former, then some of the more ludicrous elements she
has introduced are flaws in the design. If the latter, then the massive
amount of backstory that she *has* provided in her various website
articles is superfluous, unnecessary, and frankly a waste of time.  If
you want to write a farce, do so.  If you want to engage in some world
building to satisfy those, like myself, who want more detail, then take
us seriously.

One thing is abundantly clear, and this quote says it perfectly.
