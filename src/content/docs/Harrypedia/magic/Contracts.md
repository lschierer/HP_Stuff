title: Magical Contracts
author: Luke Schierer

Other than the goblet itself in _[the Goblet of Fire]_, we do not see any magical contracts in the canonical works.  That is, unless you count the so called "Unbreakable Vow" as a contract.  I, like other authors,[^240313-2] believe that this is, in fact, a second example of a magical contract.  There are a number of problems with this concept, and a few different authors have poked at some of these, some of whom have done so quite well.[^240313-3]  

Given that magical contracts exist, you could even see the logic behind [cbsmith17]'s [unfinished story][ttpbc] in which they are used to *protect* children from being trapped by still worse contracts.  Magical society over the centuries has probably learned to its horror that marriage contracts are dangerous things.  That would not stop someone like a [Malfoy] from being short sighted in a desire to hurt an enemy.  It is also probably something that magical society tried more than once, and probably eventually figured out *something* around, since in non-magical society, they were common.[^240313-5]

Further, again, given that magical contracts *must* exist, it makes sense that wizards would sign them in blood.  Not necessarily that they would *need* to be signed in blood, the Goblet did not require any blood for example, but that a culture obsessed with bloodlines, and which thinks that magic resides "in the blood," would *think* that a contract would gain power from being signed that way.  So it makes sense that many fan fiction authors have disregarded Mrs. Rowling's claim that [Umbridge] created the quill she forces [Harry] to use herself.[^240313-4]  One possible explanation is that there *is* such a thing as blood quill in the magical world, but that she has cursed hers to scar.  Considering the number of contracts that a person might need to sign over the course of a long life, you would not want your name scratched on the back of your hand after all. 

There are a several of key points that need to be established that Mrs. Rowling has left badly undefined. 

### Consent 

Unbreakable Vows are performed with a sort of mini ritual.  The Goblet of Fire apparently lets anyone (since it was not even *actually* a teacher who drops [Harry]'s name in) drop any name in.  What *is* required for a contract to form?  
Can you be tricked into signing?  Can you be perhaps tricked in that you know you are signing a contract, but you failed to read, or failed to understand, the terms? Can magic be used to conceal the terms? Can magic be used to compel you to sign? Is a signature under duress a binding consent (in this society the law would follow the magic)?   Who can sign for a minor (i.e who can put [Harry]'s name in the Goblet)? 

### Limitations

The consequences of breaching the magical contract in [Goblet of Fire] are not defined.  It is implied that it is *either* impossible or severe, it is certainly unclear which.  Are contracts only limited by the imagination of the author (of the contract)?  

### Durability

This is related to both of the preceding two concerns.  Can a contract be inherited?  In United States law there are limitations on how, when, and to what extent debt can be inherited.  One favourite idea in many fan fiction stories is for a marriage contract to have been written generations ago, but in vague terms.  For example a patriarch of family X might write one for "a daughter of family X" rather than for a specifically named individual.  This would allow you to write a contract that would eventually be fulfilled when eventually a birth takes place, that child grows up, and gets married.  In an age with high child mortality, leaving the child unspecified might seem attractive if you are using a marriage between clans as a method to bring an end to conflict.  Both clans would be magically bound to what is effectively a treaty between them so long as any child, *including any future child* might possibly someday match the conditions.  

### Applicability

How frequently were they used?  In what situations?  Was it common to make every contract magically enforced?  Or only "special" contracts?  *Are* marriages regularly magically binding?  If so, how frequently are other contractual terms (for example a dowry) included?
