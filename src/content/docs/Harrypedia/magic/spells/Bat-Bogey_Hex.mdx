This hex is poorly described.  We know it causes snot in your nose to turn into
bats (of unknown size), and to possiblyattack you in some way.  Per secondary
cannon, this is a true transfiguration, that is the snot *becomes* black bats.
It remains unclear if the bats fly away (as a true bat would) or attack.  Given
the fear that the Weasley brothers have for this spell, I think they must do
more than just fly away.
