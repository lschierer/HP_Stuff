## Classification

Contract/Charm

## Description

Two people, one of whom is making the vow and the other receiving it, kneel
facing each other, and clasp hands.[^220726-6] A third acts as "bonder" and
holds his/her wand to their hands.[^220726-7]  I am unsure if there are always
three clauses, or if the number of clauses may vary.

This forms an unbreakable magical contract, and any violation of the resulting
vow/contract results in the death of the breaker (the one who made the
vow).[^220726-8]
