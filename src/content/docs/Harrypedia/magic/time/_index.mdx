Time travel is fascinating, complex, and confusing.  It is perhaps not
surprising then that Mrs. Rowling, who freely admits that she is bad at numbers
(as I am myself), only partially fleshes out this aspect of her world and
largely confines it to a single book.  It is not so much that *maths* are so
necessary for time travel, but really, think about it, Hogwarts always starts
on September 1st, which always seems to be a Monday.  Does that sound like a
promising start to an in depth exploration of time?
