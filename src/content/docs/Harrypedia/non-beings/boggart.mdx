In creating the Boggart, Mrs. Rowling seems to have lifted a word out of Celtic
mythology,[^211021-10] only to then entirely disregard the backstory that
mythology would normally imply.

### Level of Intelligence

Like the [Dementor](../dementor/), this is fairly debatable.  Mrs.
Rowling [tells][] us of several boggarts that have taken on the shape of humans
for fairly long durations.[^211021-11]  What she does not tell us is enough
detail to know if these boggarts could pass a "[Turing Test]".

### Analysis

Unlike the [Dementors](dementor), there are no obvious inconsistencies with
the boggarts.  That is not to say there are no concerns.  These particular
[non-beings](../) exemplify the problems with the [balance of
power](../../balance) more clearly than, I think, anything else in the books
do.  They can become *anything*, **_including having a reasonably effective
facsimile of that something's magic_** (thus it can become a
[Dementor](dementor).  Even if it is a somewhat weakened facsimile, the fact
that it can resurrect a suppressed memory and cause [Harry] to faint means
that it is still a frighteningly over-powered creature.
