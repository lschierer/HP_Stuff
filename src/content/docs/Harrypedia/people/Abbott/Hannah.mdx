### Analysis


The Abbott family is listed as one of the so-called "Sacred Twenty-Eight",
[^211004-10] and yet Mrs. Rowling seems to have had a fair amount of trouble
settling on Hannah's [blood status].[^211004-11]  Hannah appears in the
books only a few times, the first is a very ineffectual defence of [Harry]
where she initially states he cannot be the heir of [Slytherin][Salazar] but
backs down in the face of [Ernie Macmillan][Ernie]'s assured intransigence.
[^211004-12]  The next, we see her wearing a "Support Cedric" badge, but it
does not say anything about her interacting with [Harry] directly.
[^211004-13]  We then hear that she is pulled from school because her mother
is killed in an attack by either [Riddle] or his Death Eaters.[^211004-14]
Lastly, we know she fought in the last battle.[^211004-15]

One of the curious things is how few works pair [Harry][] with Hannah Abbott.
It seems that most authors hold either the fact that she is unable to stand
up to peer pressure for a boy she's never even spoken to, or the fact that
she values loyalty to her own house (we have no proof she knows about, uses,
or approves of the badges' second message) against her.
