### Physical Appearance

> A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudgeâ€™s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding.[^221213-3] 

She has a "booming" voice.[^221213-5]

### About Her

We know very little about Amelia Bones from cannon sources.  [Tonks][] says
that she is fair, and thinks well of her.[^221213-2]  And sure enough, she is
the only one to follow up on the evidence that [Harry][] presents at his
trial.[^221213-4]  Despite that, she allows there to *be* a trial, and until
this book, we do know know that there *is* a head of Magical Law Enforcement,
because [Fudge][] appears to be doing the job.[^221213-6]  This does not speak
well of her control over her department, her political influence, or the
respect with which she might be held.


[^221213-6]: It is after all [Fudge][] who arrests [Hagrid][] and handles
  [Sirius][]' escape from Azkaban.  Surely these would normally be the job of a
  Head of Magical Law Enforcement, not the equivalent of the Head of State and
  Government?
