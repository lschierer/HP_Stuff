### Analysis

The [Harry Potter Wiki] lists Lavender as dying in the battle on May 2nd
from the wounds received from [Greyback],[^230906-1] the problem is, as the
[Lexicon] notes,[^230906-2] that in the [book][dh], [Hermione] blasted
[Greyback]
away before he even reached her.  This renders the actress' interview comment
[^230906-3] about dying moot, as the movies have no canonical basis when they
deviate from the books.

It is possible that she died from injuries sustained before or because of
the fall, or even after [Hermione] blasted [Greyback].  If so, however, I
have seen no canonical documentation for the belief.
