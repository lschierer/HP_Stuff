Per an interview, Daphne was part of Pansy Parkinson's "gang"[^200520-1].  This
is apparently established as part of book 5, but seems to be fairly debated.  A
word search on the American Kindle edition shows her name only in relation to
the Charms OWL practicals.  Interestingly Pansy, Millicent and a Sixth Year girl
are members of the Inquisitorial Squad, but Daphne is not.  Why did Umbridge not
trust her?

Even less is available about her younger sister Astoria. Much of what we do know
about her (Astoria) requires taking _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ as part
of cannon, something I tend not to do.  Mrs. Rowling says Astoria went "through
a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood
ideals to a more tolerant life view."[^200701-1] The interesting thing about
this paragraph is that it is nearly all innuendo and comparison with few direct
statements. It says *Daphne* is a Slytherin, but nothing of Astoria's sorting.
It says Astoria believed pure-blood ideals, but while Draco's upbringing talks
specifically about being a Death Eater upbringing, there is a curious lack of
specificity about Astoria. I find it curious that Narcissa and Lucius "had high
hopes" based on her family's status on the Sacred Twenty-Eight.  If her father
had been a Death Eater along with Lucius, surely they would have more than
merely that to base their hopes on?

Both girls appear to have an uncle, Gareth Greengrass, which I am inferring from
the fact that the wiki lists him as having only one daughter, which is neither
known girl, and his wife as having a brother-in-law.  The uncle was apparently
not a death eater, but if you accept _Harry Potter: Wizards Unite_ as
canonical, he did get himself in trouble violating the Statute of Secrecy.
