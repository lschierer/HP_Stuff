### Analysis

### Mini Rant about not understanding the character 

Sometimes I think that Mrs. Rowling, and people in general, have an over
obsessive need to redeem and whitewash *everyone*.  I am sorry to tell you, but
[sin is real][].  

I bring this up because there are way too many fan fiction works out there that
feature a *good Lucius Malfoy[^glm]*.  Nor is this always being done entirely
for satire or entirely just because the author wants to turn everything on its
head (though there are examples of both out there).  Rather, many of these
happen because the author objects to the more correct portrayal of Lucius as a
villain.

[^glm]: For example, see [this search][ao3glm].

### Facts

* Lucius is a marked death eater
* Lucius despises both non-magical people and first generation magical people as beneath him.  He is in fact a pure blood bigot.
* Lucius put the diary in [Ginny][]'s cauldron, intending harm to a *child* as part of a political manoeuvre. 
* Lucius *had* the diary because [Riddle][] considered him a reliable and dedicated death eater. 
* Lucius spends the last battle mostly standing on the sidelines as a sycophant, before, in the last mad scramble, frantically looking for his son. 

### Analysis

This last bullet point comes after [Riddle] has spent much of book seven
threatening Lucius' life, health, social position, and family.  In other words,
after he has seen the master whom he served loyally in the first war reward
that loyalty with the loss of everything Lucius values.  It should come as no
surprise that Lucius no longer feels all that loyal.  But note that unlike his
wife, he does not actually *do* anything.  The final battle is _**not**_
sufficient reason to overturn our general impression of this man.

Very few people, if any, are so lost to sin as to be *entirely* devoid of
virtue.  Lucius has *many* faults, but he does value his family.  We have no
*real* data on his skill as a father outside of [Draco][]'s behaviour however,
and that is â€¦ not good.  How much of that is because of actual bad parenting,
and how much of that is because you simply *cannot* be an actually good parent
when you think that you as a family *deserve* aristocratic privilege?  Not
privilege, but the kind of privilege that makes for the stereotypes of french
nobility at the time of the French Revolution.  When you think that kind of
behaviour is *correct* (and Lucius does), is it *possible* to teach good
behaviour?

We do not actually know, mind you, that Lucius is in fact "Lord Malfoy."  We
just know that he *wants to be.*  This man is very much the grandchild (with
however many greats inserted) of the man of whom Mrs. Rowling implies a plot to
seduce Queen Elizabeth and thus take over the throne of England.[^230104-1]
