### Analysis

#### Effects of abuse

See the [Dursleys][] for some discussion on just how much and in what ways
Harry is abused.  That he is abused to at least some extent is pretty
much undeniable.  The only real question is how does he survive it?  How
much of his personality is in fact reflective of, to be brutally honest,
damage, how much is innate, how much is resilience, how much is residual
from the first year when he was loved?  Some of it, how much is impossible to
estimate, will be hard to explain with those answers. Some of his
personality will need some sort of hand-wavy answer of "the story requires
it for his character to work" (or in other words, this is a made up
character who is simply not realistic).  Any attempt to make it less
impossible essentially requires something along the lines of his mother's
sacrifice not just magically protected him from Tom, but also magically
protected him from the worst of the effects of his upbringing.

[_Don't Touch Me_](https://archiveofourown.org/works/702684) by ivybelle
explores as a one-shot from when Harry and [Ginny][] are dating the idea that
perhaps Harry is simply really really good at hiding his reactions.[^200527-1]

#### Slytherin?

The sorting is increasingly a sore point for me.  A huge body of fan fiction
authors want to put Harry in Slytherin.  I know why - they are listening to the
Sorting Hat:

> “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
> courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes
> and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where
> shall I put you?”
>
> Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, *Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.*
>
> “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great,
> you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way
> to greatness, no doubt about that no? Well, if you’re sure better be
> GRYFFINDOR!”[^200602-1]

However, are cunning or ambition really defining traits for Harry?  He might
have liked his scar in the first chapters, but do not let the movies fool you,
that does not last long.  Even in that first Leaky Cauldron scene the books
describe a very different Harry, one who is overwhelmed, not pleased by his
fame.  Once at Hogwarts, Harry finds the attention annoying pretty much right
from the start, and will spend the next 7 years *hating* his fame.  This dislike
of attention will grow so strong that Harry will have trouble accepting praise
not only for being the Boy Who Lived (understandable, he does not remember doing
anything to earn that) but even for his skills on a broom, the fight with the
basilisk, and the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  He keeps switching between being
annoyed when he's babied (by Mrs. Weasley or other adults), and crediting
everything to luck precisely because he *does not* seek fame.

This does not mesh well with the ambition that Slytherin is known for to me.
Indeed, Harry's loyalty to his friends, his willingness to forgive them with
very little in the way of a real apology, and readiness to risk everything for
them speaks more strongly of Hufflepuff than any of his actual actions do of
Slytherin.

Originally I thought that Rowling tried too hard to force the parallel between
Harry and [Riddle][], playing up that Harry could have been in Slytherin but
for his choices.  A different theory was presented in an interview.[^200731-3]
The Sorting Hat accidentally attempted to sort *[Riddle][]* and not *Harry* in
attempting the placement in Slytherin.  The Sorting Hat was not intended to sort
a person with a bit of someone else's soul in them.  This confused the hat, and
as a result it wasn't sure which person's traits to sort based on.  The hat, not
being truly alive, is not really able to reconsider or learn, so it stands by
its opinions.  It will do so until/unless it were to be placed on Harry's head
after the bit of Riddle's soul is removed.

In short, perhaps the boy that Harry *could* have been - abused as he was in
reality - should have shown more Slytherin tendencies, but the actual Harry that
we see in the books would make a *really really poor* Slytherin, a fairly good
Hufflepuff, and an uncertain Ravenclaw (depending on how much he would have been
willing to use that "not a bad mind" mentioned above away from Ron's influence).

### Relationships

See my overview on [Shipping][].  The problem is that the series is, with very
very few exceptions, third-person limited with a Harry point of view, *and*
skips around to show *mostly* only "significant" (ie the kind that history books
pivot on) moments in his life.  We do not see the bulk of his daily interactions
with anyone.  We never see him attending the Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw Quidditch game
for example.  Similarly it is not uncommon for the books to jump over weeks and
even occasionally (especially in the earlier books) months where nothing
significant happens.

[Shipping]: <../../../shipping>

This is a problem because it is in these non-significant times that Harry would
be growing in relationship with all the rest of his classmates, year mates, and
housemates.  He would be at meals with them, in the library working on
assignments around them, in the common room hanging out.  They are living in
close proximity for ten months of each year, it is really interesting that
despite this, at the formational meeting for the DA, Harry is apparently unsure
of Susan's name, despite the fact that she has been in his herbology class for
*four years* (not counting the bit of fifth year) at that point.[^221130-1]  I
had 280 people in my high school class, and by the end of senior year, I
probably had a few that I did not immediately recognise by name, even though
many I knew nothing else about them, but *most* of them I knew at least that
much.  It is *crazy* to think that, with only forty people in his class, Harry
did not learn at least their last names and faces (since the professors mostly
use last names).

I almost put this in the section about affects of abuse, because I think it
*does* partly come down to that, but more, I think it is partly a reaction to
the way Harry is treated after he starts at Hogwarts.  He is not *really* a
*person* to most of his fellow students.  He is "The Boy Who Lived" and they go
out of their way to see him in the halls while making no effort to disguise the
fact that they are talking about him *incessantly*.[^221130-2]  Even if this
persisted only a short time, it made a profound impression on Harry, who *does*
come from an abusive background where attention is associated with pain.  He is
not used to it, nor comfortable being the focus of it. *This* I think, is why
he so profoundly self-isolates that he doesn't even learn the names of his
classmates.  He is not really a *classmate* to them, and so they in turn do not
settle into distinct individuals in *his* mind either.

### Appearance

On a truly trivial note, the scene from [Snape][SS1]'s memory showing the
confrontation after the OWL tests shows that [James] purposefully messed up
his hair.[^200710-1]  Harry's hair is unfix-ably messy.  Unfortunately, we know
that while [James] did mess up his hair, it was also unfix-ably untidy.[^200710-2]
The most likely explanation of this is that it is purely genetic, but lots of
authors have had fun speculating a magical origin for this hair.  I read one
idea that I found really amusing, that Harry's hair was a prank that [James]
played on [Lily][].[^200710-3]  As I said, the book 1 evidence probably contradicts
the theory, but it is a great one.

At the beginning of book 5, we read that Harry "was a skinny, black-haired,
bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who
has grown a lot in a short space of time."[^221024-1]  Since at the end of book
four we know that [James] Potter was still taller than Harry,[^221024-2] either
this growth spurt happened *after* the graveyard scene (despite Harry's poor
diet at Privet Drive), or it was insufficient to make him taller than his
father.  Either way, Harry observed that he is roughly the same height his
father was at age 15/16 by the *end* of that year.[^221024-3]  So either the
effects of his childhood malnutrition have been healed, or Mrs. Rowling
(possibly unconsciously) chose to utterly ignore the high probability of such
effects.[^221024-4]  Either way, we *still* have no clear indication of exactly
how tall this is.  We know only a few things definitively:
 * that by the beginning of book seven, Harry is taller than [Hermione][] and
   Mundungus, and shorter than [Ron][], [Fred][] and
   [George][].[^221024-5]
 * [James Potter][James] is described as tall by [Riddle][].[^221024-6]

See my further comments on [growth][].

While some authors highly object to Harry looking so very like [James][], I
have seen families where one or more children take *very* strongly after one of
the two parents.  Thus, this does not bother me.  What does is the repeated
emphasis on him having [Lily]'s eyes, yet he has *[James][]'* vision.  That, to
me, *does* require explanation.  Fortunately for the over analytical reader,
there are reasonable, if unconfirmed, explanations available.  Harry's need for
glasses is probably either an effect of from his scar, or an effect from living
in the cupboard.  Since both are speculation, we do not know which.
