### Analysis

There are two competing arguments for Charlie's birthday.  I am currently foregoing
Troels Forchhammer's "[The Age of the Weasleys][TAW]" in favor of Philip Legge's
"[Quidditch Through the (Weasleysâ€™) Ages][QTWA]".  Both are well reasoned, but
the latter seems to fit better to me.[^221202-3]  At some point I need to sit
down and closely compare them and *prove* one of the two wrong, but I have not
done so yet.

[^221202-3]: my thinking was influenced by "[The Weasley Calendar](https://www.redhen-publications.com/Wcalendar.html)"
