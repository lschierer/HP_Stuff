### Analysis
#### Snippet analysis

> “There’s room in this one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here — ”
> 
> Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone. 
> 
> “Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.” 
> 
> She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and Neville

> 
> “Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?”[^20210513-3]

This is probably the most troublesome thing that Ginny says in the entire
series.  It is also the biggest counter example to trying to deal with the next
quote.  The only interesting thing is that while Ginny uses the name "Loony"
outside the compartment, she switches to "[Luna][]" as soon as they go in, and
immediately strikes up a friendly conversation with the outcast girl.  This is
not in character for someone who uses derogatory names.  The contradiction in
Ginny's behaviour is unexplained, to my knowledge, by cannon sources.

When reading this keep in mind that this is filtered through [Hermione][].
While it looks fairly harsh, PercabethHinny noted in _Discovering the Truth_
that [Hermione][] *might* be misrepresenting Ginny's actual words (emphasis
mine).[^20210513-2]

Sure Ginny offers a slight argument just below this, but [Harry][] pretty much
nails it - she *does* know him, and so she *does* accept _**and**_ *understand*
his thought process and thus decision.  She is no more happy about it than he
is, but they two of them are in sync with each other at this moment in time.

### Speculation

The interaction across book five is such that I do not think that Ginny and
[Luna][] had a strong friendship going into the book, but we do not have enough
data to tell if her familiarity with [Luna][] is solely from (at that point)
three years of being in class with her, or if it pre-dates that. 

The books do not say, but I think it had to have been Ginny that invited
[Luna][] to the meeting about organising the defence study group in _the Order
of the Phoenix_.  [Hermione][] certainly would not have done so, she has been
behaving very in a very hostile manner to [Luna][].

### Wishful Thinking

I would have liked to have seen reports of Ginny more like what we see in
bobmin's _[Healing Harry][]_ or _[Mutant Storm][]_.  In either of these works
we have a strong character who supports [Harry][] and, for lack of a better
word, repays his sacrifices by being there for him the way he has been there
not only for her, but for the entire world.   Not that [Harry][] has *earned* a
wife, which is why I hesitate to use the word "repay", but because it is heart
warming to see someone recognise his self sacrifice as worthy of love.

Ginny's career in Quidditch would have taken tremendous dedication and time
away from her family and relationship with [Harry][].  I somewhat think that
Mrs. Rowling, a single mother and politically active in the politics of
gender,[^221205-4] may not have been able to envision a young woman like Ginny
choosing the stay at home path the way her mother did.  She may also have
wanted to show Ginny pursuing her dreams *and* her marriage as a purposeful
example to her young readers, even if this did not quite make it into the
actual books.
