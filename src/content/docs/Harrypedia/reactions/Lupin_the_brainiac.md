title: Remus Lupin, Brains of the Marauders
author: Luke Schierer
---

One of the more common fannon ideas is that [Remus Lupin] was the most inteligent of the Marauders.  This is sometimes stated explicitly, other times it is done by stating that "[Hermione] is [the younger generation's] [Remus]" or that "[Hermione] is a female [Remus]."  Either way, there is a strong implication that he did the thinking and planning for [James] and [Sirius].

The problem is that [Lupin] states that [James] and [Sirius] were "the cleverest students in the school."[^240130-1]  Supporting his admittedly biased statement, [McGonagall] describes them with these words: "Both very bright, of course exceptionally bright."[^240130-2]  This flatly contradicts the idea that the pair of them were morons who relied on others to do their thinking.  

This thought pattern is generally used by those who have so strongly bought into Mrs. Rowling's redemption of [Snape] that they need him to have *always* been in the right, and *actually* morally superior to those he showed such hatred and derision towards.  This is incredibly shallow thinking.  While I do not believe that [Snape] was anywhere near as reformed as Mrs. Rowling would have us believe by the Epilogue in [book seven], the redemption arc she describes is *truly* an attempt at a redemption arc.  [Snape] certainly *was* quite clearly fallen, and, per her, trying to make amends for his past failings. 

Thus we do not *actually* need to minimize [James]' intelligence.  I believe it was precisely his *actual* ability that, in part, made [Snape] resent him so much.  Do not be fooled by the comments [Snape] makes about [James] being a typical brainless jock.[^240130-3]  This is a combination of hatred and self-delusion speaking.
