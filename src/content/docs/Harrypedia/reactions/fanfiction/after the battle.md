title: fan fiction augmenting the epilogue
author: Luke Schierer

* One of the more popular ideas, I have no clue where it comes from, is that [Harry] slept for 36 hours straight following the scene with [Dumbledore]'s portrait in office for the headmaster/headmistress.  They forget his badder capacity is limited.  I do not doubt he was dehydrated that morning, and that would have extended the amount of time he could sleep, but not by *that* much.  I expect he would have topped out at 12 or 13 hours. 
* It is hard to envision exactly how [Harry] and [Ginny] dealt with their varied issues, including their relationship, after the war.  There are so many thorny unknowns to navigate, and many of them deal with crucial questions about exactly understanding who precisely [Ginny] is as a person, something that Mrs. Rowling largely omitted from the books.   The following list more or less summarises these questions, and the difficult nature of them in turn is why I am largely dissatisfied with fan fiction attempting to either augment or replace the official ending to the series. 
  * In book seven, we see [Harry] watching her dot on the map to "make sure she was safe."[^240424-4]  He would have to face the fact that she wasn't.  This *might* have nothing to do with her being either his current or ex girlfriend, but rather that [Neville] tells us that the students were being chained, starved, and used as test subjects for the dark arts.[^240424-5]  
  * [Ginny] may have understood why he broke up with her, that does not mean she accepts his decision to enter the forest and turn himself in.  She may not do so even after learning about the [horcrux] that [Dumbledore] believed [Harry] to be. 
  * [Ginny] appears to have accepted his decisions as the battle became immanent, asking her to stay in the Room of Requirement.  On the other hand, she ran off to join the battle as soon as he gave her an excuse to do so.  His over protectiveness may come up further. 
  * Both of them need to process their grief and survivor's guilt.  Would this make them cling to each other more, or push each other away? Would each react the same way, or would each react differently? 
  * This list basically boils down to how well would they communicate when [Harry] has a history of bottling his thoughts and feelings up until he explodes, while [Ginny] is known for hexing people who annoy her?  The fight could be epic - and easily form a rift between them. 
    * Would she *want* to tell him about her traumatic year?  She would certainly want *credit* for it, but that is not at all the same thing.  
    * If she *does* tell him anything of her traumatic year, would he get defensive, more depressed, or both? My guess is more depressed, but not defensive.  However, my guess is that she *would* face denial from other family members and *might* take that out on [Harry].  
    * How much patience would she show in dealing with *his* issues surrounding the walk to the forest?  No matter how patient she is *inclined* to be, the rest of the world won't be patient and she also won't like hearing about things from other people (or worse, the news) all the time.
