Considered a branch of [magic][], this may be the least explained and most
confusing of the classes that [Harry][] actually takes.  This is interesting,
because even more than [Flitwick][], and totally unlike both [Snape][] and
[Slughorn][], we actually read about [Harry][] taking notes in this class.  We
just do not have solid information about the *content* of these notes.

### Animate to Inanimate Transfiguration

The story _[Meaning of One, Part One][]_ was written around the time of the
sixth official book.  Despite the contradiction with cannon, it brings up an
interesting point.  In that story, [Bill][] talks about the ancient
[Egyptians][] using transfiguration as a trap.[^221220-1]  Per the ideas in
that story, the victims of such a trap experience a severe form of sensory
deprivation, and often never fully recover from it.[^221220-2]  

Contrast this to [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince][], in which
[Slughorn][] disguises himself as an arm chair.  Rather than experiencing
sensory deprivation, he is acutely aware when [Dumbledore][] pokes him with a
[wand][], despite being in the form of a chair.[^221220-3]

Did [Slughorn], who certainly did not intend to damage himself, purposefully
only incompletely transfigure himself?  Or is Sovran's theory of sensory
deprivation entirely uncanonical, despite its logical soundness?
