    blurb: Hadrian's Wall marks the northern extent of Christianity.
    description: >
      This is pure speculation on my part. I am basing this on the fact that the
      Wall marks the furthest north that the Romans had a consist presence. I
      have found no evidence that missionaries were particularly effective among
      the Pict or Scots.
