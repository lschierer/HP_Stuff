    blurb: Historical King Arthur
    description: >
      While the historical reality of King Arthur is uncertain, he would necessarily 
      exist in this timeline.  To the extent that King Arthur and Merlin are 
      historical, they are somewhere in the 500s.  Merlin could not have been sorted 
      into Slytherin, despite the Mrs. Rowling claims.
