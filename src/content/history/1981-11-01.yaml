    blurb: Hagrid flies over Bristol.
    description: |
      [Hagrid] says he flew over Bristol. There is very very little of the West Country in 
      which Godric's Hollow could be located for Bristol to be between it and Surrey.  
      Instead, Bristol seems to indicate a detour to the north, or a point of origin in Wales.
