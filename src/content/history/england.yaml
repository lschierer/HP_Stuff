    blurb: First recorded act of a witenagemot
    description: |
      The witenagemot, or Witans, were a collection of the ranking nobles and, after the introduction of Christianity, clergy of the country.  They were called together to advise the king (or queen), to witness key legislative acts, and, based on the evidence, to themselves legislate.  Their role seems to vary over time and to have been poorly defined.  If it was codified in law, the evidence of it has not survived.

      with only England and some sort of feudal relationship with Ireland.
