I am not often a fan of [Hermione] as a romantic partner for [Harry]. That
being said, occasionally you come across one that, despite the pairing, is
incredibly well done. Almost even more rare is a story in which she is the central character paired with _anyone else_ and yet remains well worth reading.

      Comments: This actually features [Neville], not [Hermione], but the story line is their relationship's development.  It is really well done, and the relationship between them feels incredibly *right* as it makes subtle changes to the story line.

        Comments: The idea of using magic to implement a body swap like the old _[Freaky Friday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076054/)_ movie is an interesting one.  We see instances of possession in the books, and polyjuice is sort of a one-way body switchMap, so it is not a *huge* leap from the magic we seen in the cannonical sources. This one features
        [Hermione] and [Fred], which is a bit unusual and offers an interesting twist on the concept.

        Comments: Harry starts dating Hermione in the time-gap between Halloween and the first task of the TriWizard Tournament.  He discovers that Dumbledore could have declared the initial champion selection invalid, and that the Goblet of Fire is much more powerful than most people want to admit.

        Comments: I really think that RobSt bases his stories almost entirely off the movies and not the books.  That being said, I am including another of his stories because he has some good stuff in them despite his choice of pairing for Harry.  In this case, what I really like is the way [McGonagall][] is forced to face the consequences of her blind faith in [Dumbledore][].  It is also nice to see a problematic [Molly][] while [Ginny][], though a minor character, remains firmly in [Harry][]'s corner.
