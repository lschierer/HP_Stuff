  <dd>Comments: This is primarily noteworthy for a couple reasons<ul>
      <li>You rarely see [Professor Sprout][] get called out for her behaviour in book four.</li>
      <li>This is the second work I have seen with [Baron Samedi].  The idea of using evil against evil is middling interesting.</li>
      <li>The idea that the tournament means that [Harry][] is an adult is used as a plot device.</li></ul></dd>

  <dd>Comments: This story leaves the question of [Horcruxes][] in an ambiguous
      state.  It is surprisingly complete picture of [Harry][] for such a short
      one-shot, but at the expense of any real epilogue to give a sense of
      closure.  There are a number of things I like in this that are mentioned
      but not fully explored.  The author did write a sequel, but it is not
      nearly as interesting.<ul>
      <li>[Harry][] realises that many of his problems are self caused in one
          sense, but the root cause is the effectively random oscillation between
          expecting him to handle things as an adult (which he isn't yet) and
          totally consign responsibilities over *to* the adults (despite the fact
          that he can see they are failing at handling things).  I experienced
          this oscillation myself growing up, and it *does* make responding
          correctly very difficult.  As a parent now, I also see the other side,
          how difficult it is to *not* do this to children.</li>
      <li>[Harry][] realises, looking back, that part of the separation from his
          friends was his own fault.  We do not however, see more than hints of
          the *outcome* of this realisation.</li>
      <li>This story lets [Harry][] be an unusually strong wizard (most people
          cannot do nearly the wandless magic he can) without being overpowered
          (despite his prowess, without a wand he is still too weak to matter in
          a straight up magical fight).  In other words, we can see him as the
          one marked by the "Dark Lord" as "his equal."  I've argued that you
          cannot really do that even in the actual canonical books.</li></ul></dd>

    Comments: I hesitated on where best to file this story, either here, or in the [Harry]/[Ginny]
    category.  I like several things about this story.  
    * I like that [Harry]'s depression is treated as a disease that must be treated, and which compromises the legitimacy of his choices. 
    * I like that the reaction to that depression is treated as morally ambiguous.  Not because I think he would have been right to refuse treatment, but because I think it right to question the self-righteous attitudes that the culture has. 
    * I like that [Dumbledore]'s treated as a grey figure trying to do good, and not always fully succeeding. 
    * I like that the link between [Harry] and [Riddle] is presented as a disturbing thing that has consequences. 
    There are also a few things I dislike. 
    * I am not a huge fan of the reconciliation with [Draco], though I think it *much* better done than in the original canonical books. 
    * I am not a huge fan of the way [Snape] is handled, though again, I think it done in a way far superior to the original canonical books. 
    * Essentially I think any story (like this one) that shows one or both of these characters in their best light is in fact showing them at least somewhat *out* of character. I remain unconvinced that either character *has* a *truly* good "best light." 
    * I tend to prefer happy endings, this one ends on an ambiguous note that truly fits the story well, but only sometimes fits my mood.

    Comments: The later you wait for [Harry] to "wake up" and realise that something is wrong at [Hogwarts] and with [Dumbledore], the less believable it is.   This story handles that aspect, the branch point, very well.  I believe the resulting take on [Harry]'s character is left somewhat inconsistent.  I think he does a pendulum swing from more intuitive than the books to more trusting than the books.  This shift happens a couple of times, and detracts from the story.
