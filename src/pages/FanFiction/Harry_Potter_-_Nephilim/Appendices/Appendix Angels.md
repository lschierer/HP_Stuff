In angelic beings, there is very little potentiality in knowledge, when they
learn something, they learn it fully and completely, not gradually come to
understand/know it over time.  As part and parcel of this, when an angelic
being decides, its decision lasts for all time, and is by nature irrevocable.
Thus we say that free will for angelic beings consists, in some ways, of the
sole choice to obey God or to rebel against God, made once at the moment of
their creation. This is not precisely accurate, but is a reasonable working
definition.  Humans on the other hand, learn and grow over time, constantly
changing.  Thus our choices are contingent on our level of knowledge and
experience, and since that is, as I stated, always changing, our choices are
not irrevocable until the moment of death.  We can repent of past actions, and
through grace even repair our relationship with God.

[Many Waters] diverges from this.  In that universe, angels express confusion and doubt.  Not in their *ends* but in the right *means* to those ends. There is an implication that the angels in that story *could* learn and grow.  if they debate amonst themselves how best to achieve a goal, that means that two angels of equal rank can differ in perception of what is "right," and then from seeing the results, learn what works and what does not.  I believe this happens
because she has embeded the angels as interacting so interpersonally with humanity in time, that they themselves must be in time.  Being in time to some degree, they are subject to learning in time to at least that degree.

This work will use this divergence.
