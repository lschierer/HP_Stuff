### Overview

Since I need non-Mendelian inheritance to explain both magical creatures and the
nephilim themselves, I am going to set some rules.  These are primarily for the
nephilim, the inheritance for magical creatures may follow modified versions of
these rules depending on exactly how the creature in question came to exist.
These rules are hierarchical, that is you need to apply the rules in order to
determine what happens to a given child.

1. Children born of at least one magical parent have a 80% chance of following
   these rules, and a 20% chance of following purely human inheritance patterns,
   which I will refer to as Mendelian genetics for simplicity.  If they follow
   Mendelian genetics, any magical abilities will tend to degrade with each
   generation that follows Mendelian genetics. In other words, they will become
   more and more normal, more and more in line with the way the world would have
   worked without disruption or intervention.
1. Children not following Mendelian genetics will have a 80% chance of still
   following Mendelian for traits not influenced by the deviation that
   distinguishes them from the mundane (in the nephilim this includes height,
   skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, so on).
1. For every generation that a mundane trait *does not* follow Mendelian
   genetics, the odds that the next generation also will not increases by 10%.
   Thus things like Weasley red hair (many generations), or Potter hair (at
   least 3 generations) start to become non-mundane traits.
1. For non-mundane traits, a male child will have (a female child has similar
   numbers, but switch father/mother). This is computed *per trait*.
    * a 50% chance of inheriting solely from his father,
    * a 16% chance of inheriting the sum total of both parents,
    * a 14% chance of a partial inheritance from both parents,
    * a 7.5% chance of a partial inheritance from just his father,
    * a 7% chance of inheriting solely from his mother,
    * a 4% chance of a partial inheritance from just his mother,
    * a 1% chance of something truly bizarre happening
    * a 0.5% chance of becoming mundane,
   Originally, centuries in the past, people tended to be highly specialised
   into one of these.  If you inherited an angelic nature as a single unit,
   there would be a 30% chance of a child mixing the magical/angelic heritage of
   his/her parents.  Since instead my thought is that each is an independent
   trait, each of which has a 30% chance, mixing is pretty much guaranteed to
   happen fairly rapidly.  In practice, in the modern era, every child invited
   to a magical school has a reasonably mixed heritage, though the precise
   values 1-10 for each category differ significantly from child to child.
1. Recall that I said that magic can be inherently corrupting.  Magic that is
   corrupting not only affects the user, but his/her descendants, four
   generations out.  All magic that *requires* an emotional content
   () fits in this category.
   - by corrupting, I do not necessarily mean that it tends the user towards
     evil, I mean that it tends to change (corrupt) the nature of the user.
   -    -    -
   -
   -
   -
   -
   -
   -    -
   - As stated elsewhere, this effect lasts for four generations.
   - 1. Harry Potter talks about two classes that require special mention, squibs and
   muggle born.  They are effectively inverse of each other.
   * A true squib is the child who resulted from the 0.5% chance of becoming
     mundane.  Such a child is fully human, and no "muggle-born" will ever
     descend from such a child.
   * It is possible for a child receiving a partial inheritance from his or her
     parent(s) to have very low power.
     - A child with a power level of 2 or below on all categories will be called
       a squib.
     - A child with 3 or below on all categories will not be invited to any
       magical school, but might be able to effectively use some magic.
       - A program like Kwick Spell might prey on such people.
       - Such a child might still be called a squib despite actually being able to use magic.
       Hogwarts requires at least a 4 in each of the following categories:
       Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; at least a 4 in *one* of Archangels or
       angels and at least a 3 in the other; and at least a 3 in each of
       Cherubim and Principalities.  However, a child who got in just barely
       meeting these minimums would be very unlikely to get into NEWT level
       classes.
   * Because it is possible (16% chance) for the parents' abilities to
     recombine, these "squibs" who are actually extremely low powered nephilim,
     can eventually produce higher powered children.  These children will
     *generally* be low powered (a mix of 3s, 4s and 5s in the various
     categories).  However, sometimes (base rate of a 1% chance) the something
     bizarre increases the child's ability beyond expectations.
   * This partially explains some of the bias against these "first generation"
     magical users.  Not only are they new to a xenophobic culture, but marrying
     them *generally* creates a risk of low powered children.  With this
     background, being of "pure" blood is basically ignoring the 19.5% chance of
     being under powered as compared to your parents. Illogical, but considering
     other human prejudices, not unreasonable.
   * Per my [base assumptions][AA], it is possible for
     a pure human to gain magic through the union with a fallen angel.  In
     practice, this has not happened in centuries, but magical society
     remembers adults suddenly having magic where none had been present before.
     From this comes stories of magic being "stolen."  This is not true of
     course, no one lost the magic the witch gained from her unholy union, but
     most magic users do not believe in angels, much less fallen angels, and
     have a strong distrust for the Church.

### Specifically human/nephil

* "Standard" nephilim seem more or less humans with extra abilities, but this is
  not really true. If you consider creation as a hierarchy, humanity has always
  occupied a messy place - top of the material creation, bottom of the spiritual
  order, but destined, through grace, not merit, to be raised above its (our)
  natural place.  Introducing the nephilim in this fictional world, I am putting
  the nephilim as being an unnatural hybrid of two things God created. In making
  this hybrid, something of each was lost. They are thus *slightly* lesser than
  humans, and *entirely* outside the intended, natural hierarchy. Despite
  having greater capabilities in some ways, they have deficits in others, most
  notably, they are overall *less free.*  Think of mules, they have advantages,
  in certain circumstances, over both donkeys and horses, but they are not
  really a stable species at all, and in some ways (specifically fertility)
  less than either.



  Nephil have some aspects of both.  They are *mostly* contingent beings that
  grow and change over time, but their use of magic is, in this universe, the
  use of an angelic power, and so it tends to either be 1) incredibly crippled
  compared to actual angels (for example, charms wear off really fast) or 2)
  incredibly permanent. In the canon books, you cannot remove Walburga's
  portrait from the wall without removing the wall, which might have been stupid
  for a house that will be passed down through generations, but clearly
  demonstrates that a momentary decision can have effects all out of proportion
  to the result.  I am restricting that to magic used on things without immortal
  souls and to magic used on *other nephilim* (or on races descending from
  nephilim, see below).  Things that would be temptations to a human can be
  overriding compulsions to a nephil, and they are vulnerable to each other (and
  to others who can use similar powers) in ways that humans are not.  See the
  notes on [contracts].
* At some point in history, each nephil descends from a witch.  This witch had
  magic of only one type, that of the angel that seduced her.  The nephil
  inherited *only that type* of magic, and is called a "primordial" nephil.
* Per the above, in practice, most modern nephil have mixed inheritances, and
  thus magic in a broad range of categories.
* nephil do get one straight up advantage over humans in addition to using
  magic - they [live longer][AE].  This is *actually* a side effect of their
  magic, which, regardless of type, will offer some protection against disease
  and against the effects of entropy (and thus old age).  It does not halt
  the decay of old age, but it does retard it.  The extent to which it
  extends the nephil's life depends on the nephil's *average* (not highest)
  power level (only including power levels where present at all).
* Per earlier sections, it takes approximately six consecutive generations of magical
  abuse for "truly bizarre" things to become not just possible but probable.
   * Recall the note from [Appendix A][AA] on _The
     Screwtape Letters_.
   * Building on what I wrote above comparing "standard humans" to nephil,
     beings in these categories are even more corrupted by the combination of
     sin and the inherent weakness of being of a race that was made, and not
     created. For lack of of a better word, they are more nearly animals, they
     *do* have immortal souls, but, to differing degrees (depending on species)
     lack even more of the free will that is already impaired in the nephilim.
     This list is essentially ordered from most nearly equal to the nephilim to
     least nearly equal.
   * mermen - These were once a magically powerful people who used inheritances
     from the Dominions to transmute themselves to survive [the great Flood].
   * dwarfs - I really dislike what Mrs. Rowling did with the dwarfs in _the
     Chamber of Secrets_.[^210518-1]  Since she says that goblins of all
     things are expert craftsmen,[^210518-2] my take is that nephil became
     dwarfs which in turn became goblins.  I will figure out something else for
     Lockhart's cupids if I ever get that far in writing.
   * goblins - people, descendant from the dwarfs, who are highly susceptible to
     greed, envy, and wrath.  Their form has been distorted by the sins of their
     forefathers centuries ago.  Once, they would have ranked in this list below
     the veela.  However, they are still capable of good deeds, and some have
     been so highly virtuous as to have actually reduced their susceptibility
     from the 90% maximum to a more manageable 60-70%.  Similarly, the physical
     changes wrought on them have "softened" and so they are less hideous than
     described by authors like Tolkien who have packaged aspects of the magical
     world as fiction.  Despite their flaws, these populations retained their
     intelligence and their magic.  They are particularly strong inheritors from
     the Virtues, Powers, and Archangels, with lesser inheritances from the
     Principalities and angels.  Their creation of the trolls at the beginning of
     the [goblin wars] explains why they were punished so harshly (as to have
     originally lost nearly all free will - 90% impact).
   * hags - a people who are consumed by envy and lust.  They have particularly
     strong inheritances from the Thrones, reasonable inheritances from the
     Virtues and Powers.  Some have partial inheritances of random other types.
     Hags are known for using infant sacrifice in evil magical rites.  These
     sins robbed their ancestors of all they can now value.
   * centaurs - a nearly primordial people (inheriting from both the the
     Seraphim and Cherubim) who, not just as individuals, but as a people,
     selfishly abused divination magic until something truly bizarre happened.
     - Their form transmuted to a half animal form to reflect the fact that
       their free will is nearly gone.  They now have a herd instinct that rules
       much of their behaviour.
     - They became nearly immune to the magic of the Thrones as practised by
       other mortals.  It is next to impossible to confound or imperious a
       centaur for example.  This is in part because they perceive the magic of
	   the attempt.  This is a mitigation of their curse, which happened
	   because while divination is evil, their *intentions* were not, and their
	   *understanding* of their act flawed.
     - While it is, per the above, almost impossible to affect individuals with
       magical effects on the mind or free will, the *herd* is massively
       influenced at a subconscious level by the moral state of the people in
       surrounding areas.  Whenever the societies around them take a turn for
       the worse, so do they; whenever the societies they live near turn towards
       God, the centaur populations become more friendly.
     - they remain addicted to divination, as such they perpetuate these effects
       to the next generation endlessly.
     - the ranking in this list between centaur and veela is debatable.  Any
       single centaur is probably less free than any single veela, but as a
       herd, centaurs are capable of slightly more autonomy than pure veela are
       either as individuals or in groups (since veela have no herd, or in their
       case flock, effect).
   * veela - See [Appendix I].
   * giants - the physical changes wrought on them by sin have become "mundane"
     and are now governed by Mendelian inheritance.  Church [records][Giants]
     show that the giants come from the creators of the house elves. Behold in
     them what man would be if left without his mind, the only hope they have
     is that their intellects are so clouded that it is nearly impossible for
     them to actually commit a mortal sin.  Should any be willing to be
     missionary to the giants, the grace of baptism would be nearly unopposed,
     because these beings have so little ability to freely choose to do
     anything, and even less ability to understand something is gravely wrong.

    I have not copied it precisely as he came up with it, my version is
    less voluntary, and does not include the death inducing madness, nor the bond
    aspect.

### Other Races

Other "races" are not really people at all, they have varying levels of
intelligence, but are all effectively the same as meeting different qualities of
AI players, as if you were encountering cyborgs.

The creation of these "races" is an abomination, and the more nearly human, or
in other words the more perfectly they simulate free will, the greater the
abomination.  This will definitely have had *Screwtape* style bizarre effects
on the perpetrators of these crimes against creation and their descendants.
This is true because of the moral confusion it causes - these "races" do not
have immortal souls the way humans, angels, nephil, or the nephil descended
races do, and yet they appear as if they should.  It is true because their
creation mocks the creation of man.  And lastly, it is true because their
creation, particularly that of the house elves and the trolls, has created
groups that exist at odds with true charity: in the case of the trolls a "race"
that cannot rise above rage, and in the case of the house elves a "race" that
can never be fully freed.

* Acromantula - created from spiders (obviously) by an unknown nephil or group
  of nephilim.  Acromantula are capable of learning human speech, but do not
  speak anything that could be defined as a language in the wild.[^210916-3]
* Bowtruckle - created by the extreme use of magics on tree branches by an
  unknown agency (may be directly demonic).
* fairies/imps/doxies - created by the extreme use of magics on (different)
  insects, these beings appear humanoid, but still reproduce by laying eggs like
  insects.  Unlike gnomes, they have some ability to form long term memories,
  but only very limited ability to learn from these experiences; their actions
  are guided by incredibly strong instinct rather than by reasoning. They are
  very like domesticated cats and dogs in this respect; a dog might remember its
  owner, but its behaviours will always be more governed by instinct than not.
  It is known that, in addition to her crimes of enslavement, fairies and
  doxies were created by the woman who became the first veela.  It is unknown
  who first created imps.
* ghoul - unknown origin. Often treated as a pet.[^210916-4]
* gnomes - created by the extreme use of magics on clay figures, these beings
  have no long term memory at all.  It is unknown who created these.
* house elves - created by the extreme use of magics on an unknown mammal (not a
  human), they are the most nearly human of all created beings.  They are
  capable of learning, loyalty and betrayal; they have memories equivalent to
  ours.  They closely mimic having true free will, just as some human scientists
  speculate the highest animals do.  When bound, and elf can "feed" on the bond,
  using its master's magic to amplify its own.  This stronger magic also slows
  the elf's ageing process.  Any bond at all will slow an elf's ageing by a factor
  of 2 (age half a year for each year you live).  If the elf feels itself to be
  *part of the family*, the bond can slow ageing by an additional factor of 2
  (each year ages you a quarter of a year).  If the elf feels its contribution
  is *critical*, then, independent of the feeling of family, (but not
  independent of being bound) the elf can gain a factor of 2.  If the elf feels
  that it is *fully utilised* (kept free from idleness), it gains a factor of
  *4*.  Where a human gets stressed by being overworked, an elf actually gets
  *healthier* if it cannot complete the work necessary.  However, not just any
  work will have this life extending effect, only *disinterested* work does.
  That is, only work done for work's sake, or work done altruistically has the
  life-extending effect.  These effects, including the limitation on types of
  work, was (cruelly) built into them to ensure that elves would remain loyal.

  The effects of the bond have, by and large, had the desired effect.  Since the
  elf's base average lifespan is only twenty years, being unbound is a huge
  thing for elves.  Elves have grown/matured enough to start working by age
  three, and reach full physical and mental maturity around age five, which is
  the earliest they can be bound.  They were created by the ancestors of the
  giants, before they lost their magic, but after they had already grown large
  enough to need helpers with more nimble fingers.
  - a bound elf (1/2) who feels him/her self part of the family (divide by 2
    again), is critical to the family's welbeing (another 1/2 on top), and is
    fully utilised (1/4) would thus age at a rate of 1/32nd normal.  In other
    words they would live to on average 485 years old instead of 20 years (5
    years ageing at a normal rate before being bound, added to 15*32).
  - from this we can conclude that Dobby would be, in human terms, considered
    very nearly suicidal in his desire for freedom.  He was bound (factor of
    2), and fully utilised (factor of 4 on top of that), but neither part of
    the family nor critical. He thus, prior to being freed, aged at a rate of
    1/16 normal (out of a possible 1/32th).
* Leprechaun - created by the use of extreme magics on an unknown mammal, by an
  unknown being.
  > More intelligent than the fairy and less malicious than the imp, the pixie
  > or the doxy, the leprechaun is nevertheless mischievous.[^210916-5]
* Pixie - The pixie largely resembles an imp in behaviour and intelligence, but
  the fact that it bears live young suggests a different origin.  We have no
  true history of how they came to be.
* Red Cap - even less intelligent than trolls, it is suspected that like them
  they were originally created for some type of combat.  That being said, no
  real knowledge of their origin is known.
* Sphinx - created by the extreme use of magic on a lion by an Egyptian nephil,
  the only true unknown is how the sphinx survived the great Flood.  We are
  fairly confident, mostly by process of elimination, that its creators did not.
* trolls - created by the extreme use of magics on apes, the *most* intelligent
  trolls might be able to perform similarly to a human with mental retardation
  capable of living in a group home. This is not a fair comparison however, the
  human is suffering from a disability; the troll is performing with unusual
  *capability.*  Believed to be created by the ancestors of the goblins.
