As I state in [Points of Divergence][AA], Mrs. Rowling has set up a world
in which magical contracts exist, and in which they can have unwilling
participants.  This has been explored in a number of other fan fiction
works,[^230103-2] and while I do not want to rehash them, the idea is far
too useful and tempting for me to avoid.  I am at heart more of a world
builder than a story teller, so I am going to define magical contracts
rather more than Mrs. Rowling did.

First of all, the word "contract" is rather misleading.  The so called
Unbreakable Vow is not *really* a contract, but clearly falls in this
category.  These are contracts in the sense that at least one party agrees
to do or be something to, for, or with the other party, possibly, but not
necessarily, in exchange for something.

## Who can enter

Contracts can be agreed to by proxy.  Your proxy must be related to you
* with an imbalanced power relationship
  - a parent can agree for a child
  - a child cannot agree for a parent
  - a sibling cannot agree for a sibling
* by straight line inheritance
  - your direct ancestors
  - but not your aunts, uncles, great-aunts, great-uncles, so on.
  - Not a cousin even if he/she belongs to an older generation (once or more
    removed situations).
  - Note that nephilim have adopted the same concept of clan-like "houses" in
    some cultures. Despite this, the head of the "house" or "clan" has no power over the members except his/her own *direct* decedents.
* *or* by a formally recognised *delegated* parental authority.
  - this relationship must be recognised by *both sides*
  - teachers have authority delegated to them by parents for example.
    * the limits of a teacher acting in loco parientis are poorly defined
    * except that a parent can overrule or override said teacher's decisions.
  - government officials have authority delegated to them only to the
    extent they are a legitimate government.
    * I might successfully rebel against a contract foisted on me by a
      government official if *all* of the following are true:
      - I *honestly and sincerely* believe the contract unjust
      - I *honestly and sincerely* believe the government corrupt,
        illegitimate, or (most interestingly) not mine.
    * A government contract might fail to bind similarly if *any* of the
      following are true
      - the government official binding me is knowingly acting in excess
        of his/her authority
      - the government official binding me is knowingly acting on a bribe
      - the government official binding me is knowingly violating the law
        of the land in any of
        * the nature of the contract
        * the method of binding me
        * the reason for binding me

Contracts can be implicitly agreed to.  [Harry], by walking to the front of
the hall, joining the other champions in the side room, and staying for the
directions to the first tasks, implicitly accepted that he was in fact a
TriWizard contestant.   This may or may not matter for that particular case
(see above about delegated parental authority) in the canon books, but I am
going to assume it does matter magically in the general case.

## Restrictions

'Contracts' need not be written on special paper, but they must be formalised
agreements in some way.  There are many ways to formalise an agreement.
Common ones include, but are not limited to:
* full legal signature on a paper (or parchment) contract
* formal statement of agreement "I, <name>, agree to xyz"
* repeated statements of agreement
  - using significant numbers (three, seven and ten are common)
  - in short durations.
* acting as if bound to the contract (ie common law marriage) for either
  magically significant durations or contractually significant
  events/actions that are distinctly related to contract and clearly not
  part of your non-contract/pre-contract normal life
  - marriages are consummated
  - the TriWizard champions processed out of the room
  - engagement rings
  - being sorted by the Sorting Hat
* 'Contracts' do *something*.  Person A agrees to do something or be something
  for Person B.  The 'contract' may or may not be one sided.  The 'contract' may
  or may not have penalties.  However, a contract in which neither party is obligated to perform or not perform some action cannot bind.
* No 'contract' may require a nephil to perform the marital act before the age
  of 14.[^230717-3]
* 'Contract Magic' works *only* on nephilim.  It does not work on pure humans.
  Remember that contract magic works by inducing your own magic to act against you.
  * the more powerful the nephil, the more powerfully he/she can be bound.
  * The *less* powerful the nephil, the less powerful any binding.
  * Contracts cannot require the use of a type of magic you do not have, either
    for their performance, *or in their penalties*.[^230717-4]
* 'Contracts' cannot act as an [Imperius] curse or similar.  That would come
  too close to a manipulation of the Will.[^230717-5]
  - There is an exception to this, unknown to the nephil, but not unknown to
    the Church, that has caused great confusion through history.  You can bind someone to do something that *they would have done anyway*.  Occasionally this causes confusion in one or another magical society.
  - Normally contracts operate through applying force.
    * Do something and you become ill, or even die immediately (the ritual of
      the Unbreakable Vow creates a contract which, if the contract is violated,
      results in the death of the violator).
    * Agree to the contract, and no matter your will, your body does not operate
      against the contract.  This is a bit of a gray area - it is relatively
      easy for a nephil to contract something _not_ to happen.  It is next to
      impossible to contract something _to_ happen.  It will not absorb food, or
      your hand will not close (or your libido will not react).
  - There is some moral ambiguity here that the Church struggles with.
    * A contract signed by a proxy does not make the bound person morally
      culpable.
    * A contract can trigger consequences that *preasure* but do not *force*
      the nephil's Will.
    * *If* the nephil is sufficiently weak willed, he or she might give in to
      the preasure, and agree to the contract.
    * At that point, the contract can become *implicetly* signed (through
      consent) by the bound party.  Is that person now morally culpable?

[^230717-5]: per [Appendix G][AG], angels interfering to create these restrictions
   act with good intentions, but not always wisely.  You might think 'contracts'
   already do too much.  You might be right.

[^230717-3]: per [Appendix G][AG], many of the restrictions appear arbitrary.

[^230717-4]: per [Appendix G][AG], 'contract' magic was nearly useless until nephilim
   started to have widely mixed heritages.

## Effects

With the one odd loophole noted above, 'Contracts' cannot force you to do something
the way the [Imperius] curse does.  Rather, they force behaviour through the
existence of penalties.  You can break an "Unbreakable Vow" but you die as a result.  When
a secret keeper "contracts" to keep a secret, in a sense _everyone else_ is bound
not to know something yes.  But I think that's why James and Lily had to go
to the cottage in Godric's Hollow.  They had to go to a house that was
*not* known to be theirs to hide the location of their house.  Otherwise
the widespread knowledge of their home's location by those who did not
consent to have said location hidden would have prevented the spell.

Thus for this work the limitation on the Fidelius Charm is that the
knowledge being hidden be known only by those who are either casting the
spell or consent to the spell's casting.  I know that many other works have
other limitations instead.   So the key secret would have been that *the
Potters lived there* and the house's physical presence would have been
accidentally hidden because to see the house would (potentially) betray the
secret.  In other words, the most visible effect as described in the books
of putting Grimmauld Place under the Fidelius Charm (the way it pops into
existence when you learn the secret) is an accidental side effect of the
magic, and not the true operative bit of the spell.  This also explains why
the spell broke at the cottage, when it ceased to be the Potter's home, the
spell broke and the cottage was revealed to everyone not just those whom
Pettigrew had told.

Contracts *can* force you *feel* things.  Your emotions are just chemical
effects, a contract can make you unnaturally happy or sad, incite or
suppress physical attraction, make you hungry or nauseous, so on.  A
contract can also cause a coma or prevent restful sleep, as these are also
physical reactions and do not (directly) involve the will.  However, a
contract is not going to (for example) magically transport you like a port
key.[^230103-3]

A nephil entered into a marriage contract then could be coerced to be
faithful by magically suppressing his/her physical reactions to anyone
except the intended spouse.  This would not force you to actually go
through with the marriage, but would provide a strong incentive to do so.
A stronger contract might make you physically ill or even die if you failed
to go through with the marriage.


## Implications

### Sin

In summary, a contract can, effectively, *coerce*, but not *force* sin.  But
in Catholic theology, the level of coercion a contract can easily induce is easily
more than sufficient to meet the bar for impairing free will.  Thus a contract can
cause *serious*, but not *mortal* sin.  That being said, the Church has struggled
with this topic, some of which is summarised in [Appendix G][AG].

### Debt

This is the other very interesting situation that leads to all sorts of
weird societal issues.  Alice accepts, in some formal way, that she owes
Bob.  This can be thought of in one of two ways, either of which *can* lead
to a magical contract.  Alice has agreed *to be* in a state of debt until x
occurs or alternately, Alice has agreed to pay Bob back.  The first is a
contract to be something, the second a contract to do something.  If the
debt *can be paid*, well and good.  Alice pays her debt, and is free of the
contract.

However, what if the debt cannot be paid?  If Alice owes her life, or the
life of her child (in extreme but still realistic cases)?  Or in less
extreme cases, what if she simply owes more money than she can earn while
keeping herself alive?

Because these are unstated contracts, if they form at all, they form
*because of* expectations that the nephil themselves have formed over the
centuries.  Some of these date back to times and places like the Roman
Empire where debt slavery was a common legal practice.  While the laws of
the societies that the nephil live in have changed, the nephil have come to
expect that magic can and does create these contracts for these situations.
The terms of these contracts then are set unconsciously by the principles,
in accord with these norms passed down as part of the body of folk lore,
legend, history, and myth that they are raised with.

This kind of contract thus operates somewhat differently from other formal
contracts that a nephil might carelessly or unwittingly enter into.
Someone like Hermione, raised with no thought of slavery, would be
incapable of unconsciously binding herself into slavery by accepting a
debt.  Someone like Draco, whose family lore is filled with stories of
using debts in precisely this manner, is actually himself at greater risk
of being so bound.  A family like the Weasleys would fall somewhere in the
middle.

Lastly, children, because they are more absolute in their thinking, more
accepting of the idea that anything is possible, are more easily bound this
way than adults.  Thus nephil societies almost universally have a tendency
to isolate their children from all but the most trusted of friends and
relations.  A nephil child aware of his/her heritage will frequently grow
up knowing only his/her own extended family and one or two other families
until it is time to enter an apprenticeship, join a magical secondary
school (such as Hogwarts), or (if home schooled) join the workforce as an
adult.

Note this does not always lead to slavery.  It can also lead to what some
call Spontaneous Magical Marriage (SMM), a form of marriage contract in
which both parties may or may not have any power imbalance at all, but
which old nephil families have learned, generally the hard way, usually
caries particularly harsh penalties.  For my purposes it is because of such
a SMM event that the Black family allowed the marriage of Pollux Black to
Irma Crabbe at 13 years old.[^230711-1]  These two families with their
history of dark dealings neither one wanted to risk the penalties that the
children may have made themselves liable to.
