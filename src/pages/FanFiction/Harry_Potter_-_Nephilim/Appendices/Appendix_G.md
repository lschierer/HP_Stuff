## Metaphysical Overview

The nephilim should not exist. By way of analogy: The child born out of
wedlock has right to a married mother and father. His/her parents, however,
are _not_ married, and God does not intervene in human history to fix this.
Occasionally God rectifies this, in part, by giving the child adoptive
parents who take the place of the biological parents who were not able to
do so. That is not guaranteed however, and even when it does happen, is
sometimes not a perfect solution. Analogy is always suspect - it always
fails to explain at least as much as it explains. My point is that the
just as the child in my example did not experience justice, in this life,
the nephilim stand even further outside of the direct path of salvation history,
in this life. God will deal with them separately from humanity.

Do the nephilim have a future looking forward to salvation, united with God?
History shows that some are capable of heroic virtue, and reason tells
us that a just God will reward this. God has not, however, chosen to
reveal to us what He intends for to be the common, or average, fate of the
nephilim. Certainly He has allowed His angels to deal with them much
more harshly than He allows any in the spiritual world, fallen or unfallen,
to deal with humanity. This work of fiction is not intended to be a work
of theology, if it were, it would fail utterly, as much of it would be
_really bad_ theology. It is meant to entertain, not instruct.

Secondly, the author reminds the reader that all Appendices reflect knowledge known to at least one someone in the in-world narrative, even if it is by no means common knowledge, unless explicelty marked as being unknown to anyone. This _entire_ appendix is different in that it alone, as a whole, stands outside the work.

## Free Will

Because I am starting with _[Many Waters][MW]_ as one of my base sources for material, I feel somewhat constrained by the choices made in that work. It also happens that being so constrained allows me somewhat more flexibility in designing my concept of nephilim.

In _[Many Waters][MW]_ we see clearly that the unfallen angels have a limited perspective on Divine Providence and Will, and thus make choices based on limited information. More, they are aware that their perspective is limited, and their information incomplete. They thus struggle with choices. Not like humanity does - humanity struggles with _if_ they should do right. Angels
struggle with the question _what is right_. The unfallen angel always does what that angel perceives as right, but per _[Many Waters][MW]_ _may perceive poorly_. The resulting choices may thus be sub-optimal.

While the sanctified soul is thought to be, through grace, elevated above the angels, I believe this same limited perception would apply, _particularly_ before the final judgement. I will use that fact.

## Revelation

In real theology, we of course know that Revelation is complete, closed, and unalterable with the Ascension. In this universe there is a single exception. Angels have been somewhat willing to reveal to Church officials some details of how nephilim work that nephilim themselves, and, by extension, humanity, would be otherwise unable to discover.

I do not consider this a real exception, in that this information is not relevant to the work of humanity's salvation. It _is_ relevant to the ability of _particular_ persons of nephilim decent to survive encounters with Church officials. However, the principle of infallibility has held without deviation from the real world in this universe, and the official magisterium of the
Church has (in this universe) made few if any official pronouncements on or about nephilim, and none that depend on this extra information.

## Original Sin

Humanity inherits the effects of Adam's first sin, in that we are born already deprived from grace.[^230717-1] There is remarkably little verifiable known about angels, and the Church Fathers themselves debate about the proper translation of the the word "nephilim" that I am misusing in this story. I am left with far too wide a field in which to speculate.

I am going to speculate that the angelic powers would have their own version of original sin. That just as humanity was made to be in union with God, so that the lack of grace is a flaw in man, and a stain on his soul and personality, so too the angel. The angels were given great power, but this power was intended to be used in union with God. Clearly they did not lose all access to the power given them with the fall. However, there must have been some effect.

Whatever this effect is, the nephilim of my story would inherit that as well. Thus in a sense they would inherit two "original" sins. One from their human ancestor, and one from their angelic ancestor(s). This dual lack would further incline the nephilim away from God, temptation and concupiscence is far greater for the nephilim than for humanity.

## Divine Providence and Justice

Consistent with my use of _[Many Waters][MW]_ as a source text, for the purposes of this story, the angels have a great deal of latitude in performing acts of both mercy and justice. In the real world angelic acts are perfectly in conformity to God's will. Here the angels struggle to percieve that will, and so exercise their _own_ judgement. Humans, and the nephilim, however, cannot reliably tell the difference between Divine action and angelic action. Because angels (both fallen and unfallen) from _[Many Waters][MW]_ are also far more visibly active, the result is a far more chaotic world.

This dovetails nicely with an element that I wanted to use from _[The Screwtape Letters]_. In that work, Screwtape, the senior tempter, is transformed, and can no longer write. As such in the latter chapters of the book his letters are dictated to a secretary who acts as a scribe. I decided that given nephilim can use the powers of angels (to limited degrees), they are subject to the same punishments as angels (to equally limited degrees). Thus the nephilim who misuse their magic experience changes. On further reflection, I decided several things however.

1.  The fallen angels did something fairly bold in making the nephilim. I
    decided that they do not take any setbacks to their plans lightly, and fight back when the unfallen angels attempt to exercise control over or adminster justice to the nephilim. So we see _[Screwtape]_ style changes that originate from both the unfallen angels acting as judges, but we also see _[Screwtape]_ style changes from fallen angels for their own nepharious ends.
    - For example, the fallen angels created laws that punish the use of magic
      associated with vice (anger, envy, lust) with change. The fallen angels
      responded by punishing magic that depends upon positive emotion.
    - We do not know how much of what happened with the [Veela] is because of
      the fallen and how much is because of the unfallen angels.
1.  The nephilim continuously attempt to assert that certain magic is "dark" and
    other magic "light." There is some inherently evil magic, but more frequently the angels punish _intentions_ than _spells_.
1.  Consistent with my philosophy that good ought to be greater than evil,
    because God is God, the fallen angels are less successful in general, enough of the time that we can form generalized rules _expecting_ a less successful result from their action.

## Sacraments

I intended this long before I read this in any other work: faith, prayer, the
Sacraments, and sacramentals will often have actual effects.[^210412-5]

### Baptism and Confirmation

I believe that these sacraments would be, in essence, unaffected by the
magical nature of the nephilim. The purpose of Baptism is to wash away
the effects of sin, and to trigger a supernatural adoption and thus
introduction to grace. If humanity can inherit a fallen state from Adam
and Eve in the form of original sin, then the nephilim would inherit this
'fallenness' twice over, because they inherit something of the effects of
the angels' fall from grace as well. Baptism washes away _all sin_.

The nephilim need this sacrament, and benefit from it, even more than humanity.

Confirmation strengthens the positive effects of Baptism, further initiating
us into the life of grace and into the Church. I suspect that the Gifts of
the Holy Spirit would have an even more visible and greater effect on the
nephilim than they do on humanity. When you consider the lives of the saints,
this is a bold statement.

I do not mean that these gifts would enhance their magic. But consider the
backstory I give for the [giants] or the [goblins]. A nephil infused with
the gift "for grasping revealed truths easily and profoundly"[^230714-2] and
thus "brought to the knowledge of a greater number of truths by drawing
numerous conclusions from revealed principles"[^230714-3] will find the free
will debilitating effects of inherited sin counter balanced with incredible
power. He or she will be empowered to use the free will remaining to him
or her to avoid sin far more powerfully in part _because_ the reduced
freedom will make the remaining choices more black and white to this enhanced
perception.

### Marriage

Because of the implications of [magical contracts], the Church has been forced
to question whether nor not being a nephil is inherently an impediment to a
sacramental marriage. Most theologians (in this story) believe this to be the
case, but (again in this story) the Church has not ruled infallibly on the matter.

[magical contracts]: <../Magical Contracts/>

### Holy Orders

Like with marriage, the Church has had to wrestle with whether or not a
(male) nephil can be ordained. Again, (in this story) most theologians
believe the problems inherent in their nature form an insurmountable
impediment to the valid reception of the sacrament. In the Western Rite,
the Pope, specifically speaking as Patriarch of the Western Rite, and _not_
as head of the universal Church, has ruled that they are not to be ordained.

### Sacraments of Healing

Like Baptism and Confirmation, I believe that the two sacraments of healing
are both efficacious for (baptised) nephilim.

Specific to this story, Anointing of the Sick should be able to heal some
of the effects of "dark" magic that nephilim believe impossible to heal. God
is not and will not be limited. Just as the nephilim's physical form is
more easily permanently affected by sin, it is also more easily permanently
affected by grace.

### The Holy Eucharist

The more you understand this sacrament, the less it should be necessary to
state that this sacrament is not and cannot be affected by the difference
between a nephil and a human. The key difference is between baptised and
unbaptised.
