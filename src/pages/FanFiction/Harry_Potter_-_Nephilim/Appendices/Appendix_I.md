For the purposes of this story, veela are "dark"
creatures[^210126-4]. I have chosen to create a version of veela that
justifies the suspicion that [Molly], [Hermione][] and [Ginny][] view
[Fleur][] with. Veela have some of the strongest inheritances from the
Thrones of all humanoid magic users. The pure veela is not an example of
a primordial people. Rather, the veela race comes from an example of
true perfidy. They originate from the crimes of a particularly evil witch,
whose crimes drew her to the attention of both (on the good side) the
Powers, Principalities and Archangels, and of the fallen angels (on the bad
side). Their actions resulted in a wide variety of far reaching hereditary
effects (this is the cumulative effects over the course of history):

At one point we (humanity and the nephilim community) knew which parts of this list came from enemy action and which parts of this list came from punishment inflicted upon the veela community for their many crimes (see [the backstory] for the original, but not the only, crimes).  The incredibly harsh nature of their punishment was intended as a warning to the rest of the world to cease the making of humaniform beings, and the archangels made sure to make sure every nephil community knew what had been done and why.  However, the nephilim are particularly good at ignoring and suppressing knowledge of things they do not want to acknowledge - see [Appendix G] on Original Sin.

### Gender

All veela are female, a male child of a veela will inherit solely from the
child's father in terms of magic. This is a control placed on the
punishment to ensure it does not itself become an uncontrolled problem.

A "full veela" is a veela with a full _human_ father and a full veela parent _or_ a full nephil father and a full veela mother who did _not_ inherit _any_ magic from her father.

A "half veela" is a veela with a full _nephil_ father and a full veela parent who (against the odds, see [Appendix C]), inherited magic from her father.

A quarter veela is a veela with a full _nephil_ father and a _half_ veela parent who, (against the odds, see [Appendix C]), inherited magic from her father.

### Physical changes

Like nephil, all veela have an animal form. Where the animal form
varies with nephil, all veela have a bird for their animal form.
Where nephil control the shift to/from their animal form (though most
have come to subconsciously suppress this ability and must re-gain it
through one or more rituals, see [Appendix B]) the veela has no control.
Her form will shift to that of a bird's any time her wrath, sloth,
greed, or gluttony exceed her (incredibly minimal) control over
them. What type of bird she most resembles seems to vary from veela
community to veela community, and is the same for the entire community.
This almost always applies to half-veela as well.

Her lifespan was reduced to half that of a full human's.[^210916-1]  A half-veela has a 16% chance of inheriting the greater of the two
lifespans (her father's and her mother's), a 14% chance of inheriting the
average of the two lifespans, and a 70% chance of simply being either
veela (with a veela's lifespan) or not being veela (with the lifespan of
whatever her father is, either a nephil or a human or whatever).

The original veela community were all vultures, and a very few veela/vultures
exist to this day, particularly in parts of eastern Europe. Some centuries
after the original veela were created, some veela came to realise that
their culture was an evil one, and rebelled against both their upbringing
and their own twisted nature. In reward for this, their form was shifted
to that of an eagle, and their lifespan increased from the by about 20 years,
making them almost, but not quite, equal to the full humans, but still well below the nephilim from whom they descend. Later, as rewards for other acts of virtues, some of the eastern communities were transmuted from vultures to hawks, but were not granted additional lifespan.  In the modern era, most hawk type veela are in Bulgaria and Roumania, while most eagle type veela are in Spain and France.  There are very very few vulture type veela anywhere.

Per [the backstory], the fallen angels, full of wrath over their success
in so thoroughly corrupting a community being undermined, the veela nature
was further corrupted. Her vices, such as her temper, to get locked in
place as a perpetual temptation for her, and her decedents, to fight
hopelessly against. This can be considered an extreme case of concupiscence.

Thus, between this "revenge" against her and the consequences of her own vice
normal to any nephil (see [Appendix H]), her concupiscence was vastly increased.
A full veela has perhaps 20% of the ability to go against her instincts that a
full human does. A half-veela will generally have much more free will, divine providence generally ensures that a being that is not bound by the limits here
described for full veela inherits her father's self control.

Her reproductive system was warped such her body is sufficiently actively hostile to male sperm that female births outnumber male births by at least three
to one. She produces a natural spermicide that only affects male sperm. This is generally true of half-veela as well.

Her physical maturation is human like from age zero to the onset of
puberty, but then becomes more rapid like that of a bird's until she
reaches full physical maturity.  In the original veela community, this physical maturation would take approximately one year for a full veela after the onset of puberty, but over time different veela communities have experienced a number of _[Screwtape]_ style mutations have occurred, some making the veela more human, and others less so.  Thus now there are communities that take as little as three days to fully mature and others that take as much as five years.

Partial veela tend to take proportionately longer, averaging the normal rate of human (or nephil) maturation with that typical for the community from which her mother comes.  This still results in abnormally rapid maturation, and causes young veela (and part veela) girls to face situations they are not mentally ready for.

The veela's *mental* maturation is not accelerated during this time of accelerated physical growth, putting a mentally young girl in an adult's
body for a period of years (with all the extra self control issues adding adult hormone levels to that lack of mental maturity would imply). This is why [Fleur]'s classmates dislike her so much - people tend to expect someone who appears older to behave older. They remember the brat.

### Magical Abilities

Her inheritance from the Dominions was severely restricted (leading some scholars to mistakenly think that veela are descendent from a primordial population). While in human form she _always_ produces a super-abundance of pheromones. She cannot _not_ produce them, though with considerable effort she can control _how much_ she produces. This is true of half-veela as well, though there have existed individuals who can use the magic inherited from their father's side to increase the level of suppression to 100%.

If a veela falls in love, her pheromone ability inverts, instead of
producing pheromones that bewitch others, she produces pheromones that
perfectly mimic those produced by the person she has fallen in love with.
Combined with her weakened will power (see above), she is very poorly
equipped to control the production of these pheromones, causing her own
magic to essentially enslave her to the one she loves. This remains true
of the "half-veela."[^210916-2]  Many scholars believe that this was intended as a punishment to drive the veela towards repentance (they may or may not be correct).

In avian form, she can _only_ produce a form of naphtha that catches
fire instantly when exposed to oxygen, though fortunately (for
everyone else) she has _some_ control over this (unlike the
pheromones). Some veela/eagle communities have mastered a partial transformation
between avian and human forms. While in these partial forms, the veela
is restricted to producing naphtha, like that of the full avian form, but
retains a (very) small portion of her human intelligence.

She can transmute herself between forms, but unlike an animagus, her
shift is not under direct conscious control, but is rather tied to her
(incredibly limited) ability to control herself. Some full veela spend
nearly their entire lives as a bird. This is also true of half-veela,
though they _tend_ to have greater control over their temper, (and other
vices) and thus tend to spend much more time in human form. In a sense, the full veela is becoming an animal. Had that process completed, if any veela ever
did live her entire life as a bird, it is doubtful that her descendants
would have an immortal soul at all.

Her inheritance from the Powers was restricted such that it _cannot_
combine with her inheritance from the Dominions. No full veela is
capable of permanent transmutation, and a "half-veela" is capable of it
only to the extent her male parent was.

_ALL_ veela are female, despite the normal rules, only female children
_ever_ inherit veela powers or the physical and mental changes that now
go with them. It is _possible_ though per the above _unlikely_ that a
veela will have a male child. The child will _always_ inherit either in
a purely human fashion or _solely_ from the father. This is equally
true of half-veela. A veela's child does not get its inheritance per-trait as is normal.  There are (despite the ideas common to many fan fiction authors) **_no_** male veela.
