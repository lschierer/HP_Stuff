### Overview

Magical inheritance does not follow the normal rules discovered by Gregor Mendel and other mundane biologists, but rather follows [its own rules]. However, every magical creature is in fact a mix of magical and non-magical elements. The magical elements follow magical rules, the non-magical elements follow non-magical rules, with a few exceptions.

Periodically, a non-magical trait will get locked in as 'fixed,' that is all successive generations will inherit this despite the probabilities laid out by mundane genetics. It has essentially become a magical trait and will follow magical inheritance. No one knows why this happens.

Very rarely, some magical trait will become 'unfixed' and gradually start to fade away over successive generations. This is essentially the inverse of the trait becoming magical, and again, no one knows why this happens.

When the trait in question violates the normal mundane rules of the natural sciences, the deviation from those natural sciences tends to fade rapidly, but take several generations to fully disappear. Alternately, to the extent that only the _inheritance pattern_ deviated from the natural sciences, it may revert to normal Mendelian genetics effectively immediately.

The nephilim themselves talk about two cases that require special attention: squibs and muggle born. To understand these, you will need to refer heavily to the [magical rules of inheritance].

A true squib is the result of the miniscule chance that for all magical traits, nothing is inherited. While it cannot be said that this has _never_ happened, it is certainly the case that nearly every squib is in fact ... not one. Rather most child identified by the nephilim as squibs are in fact still nephilim, but have inherited a power level too low to be detectable by the prevailing methods of the society in question. For the England's entire recorded history, this has been the Hogwarts' [Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance].

Because it is possible for a child to inherit the sum of both parent's abilities, occasionally two such "squibs" marry and produce a child who _does_ meet the criteria for Hogwarts. This is where the so-called muggle born come from. Since this typically happens only generations later, it is rare that the child in question has any immediate connection to the family members who were cast out from the magical world.

When the Church describes and categorizes magic, it does so in terms of the angelic chiors from whom the magic is derived.[^241123-2] Hogwarts is entirely unware of this classificaiton of magic, but _if_ Hogwarts _were_ aware of it, then it would be possible to quantify what the [Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance] are looking for in accidental magic.

Using the power levels from the Church's classification system, a child born with a power level of 2 or below in all categories of magic will be called a squib. A child with a 3 or below in all categories of magic will not be invited to any magical school, but might be able to effectively use some magic. Programs like Kwick Spell prey upon such people. These children are sometimes also called squibs, particularly by the families that are more self-obsessed with power and prestege.

Hogwarts requires at least a 4 in each of the following categories: Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; at least a 4 in _one_ of Archangels or angels and at least a 3 in the other; and at least a 3 in each of Cherubim and Principalities. However, a child who got in just barely meeting these minimums would be very unlikely to get into NEWT level classes other than Muggle Studies.[^241125-6]

[^241125-6]: At the NEWT level, Herbology, Care of Magical Creatures, and Potions all require significant abilties similar to those required for _any_ wandless/silent potions brewing. See the description of potions in [Rules of Magic][AB].

Muggle Born nephilim are _usually_ relatively low powered, frequently a mix of 3s, 4s and 5s when they re-enter the magical world. The spread is because it is extremely uncommon for the child to suddenly meet the bar in all required categories at the same time. Rather, once ejected from the magical world, a child might have several 3s and even 4s, but if it is not enough to trigger an acceptance letter (in English terms), they are still not yet elegible for reentry into magical society.

While low power is the norm, there is always a base rate of something bizzare happening. Thus it is not totally unheard of for there to be a high powered muggle born student, and all but the most xenophobic members of magical society are happy to make exceptions for a first generation student who shows exceptional promise (power is always something the nephilim want). This is why a student like [Lily Evans] was so accepted, however the overall effect of the first [Riddle] war had a sufficiently negative effect on society, that [Hermione] did not experience the same acceptance.

This tendency for "first generation" students to be low powered feeds into the bias against them. The children of two high powered nephilim will more frequently be high powered themselves, and will sometimes exceed both parents. The child of a high powered nephilim and a low powered nephilim has a low but non-trivial chance however of producing a child of much lower power than his/her same gendered parent. When you add in the xenophobic culture that has developed following the Statute of Secrecy, it becomes no wonder that these "first generation" nephilim are persecuted.

A _true_ "first generation" magical user would not be a nephilim at all, rather per my [base assumptions][AA], it would be _human_ who has interacted in an unholy union with a fallen angel. The child of that human/fallen angel would be the true first generation nephil, and would have only one category of power, but would be _exceptionally_ strong in that one category.

In practice, this has not happened in centuries, but magical society
remembers adults suddenly having magic where none had been present before.
From this comes stories of magic being "stolen." This is not true of
course, no one lost the magic the witch gained from her unholy union, but
most magic users do not believe in angels, much less fallen angels, and
have a strong distrust for the Church.

### Specifically human/nephil

- At some point in history, each nephil descends from a witch. This witch had
  magic of only one type, that of the angel that seduced her. The nephil
  inherited _only that type_ of magic, and is called a "primordial" nephil.
- Per the above, in practice, most modern nephil have mixed inheritances, and
  thus magic in a broad range of categories.
- nephilim do get one straight up advantage over humans in addition to using
  magic - they [live longer][AE]. This is _actually_ a side effect of their
  magic, which, regardless of type, will offer some protection against disease
  and against the effects of entropy (and thus old age). It does not halt
  the decay of old age, but it does retard it. The extent to which it
  extends the nephil's life depends on the nephil's _average_ (not highest)
  power level (only including power levels where present at all).
- European nephilim communities are obsessed with so called "purity of blood."
  Interestingly, any family that consists of unmixed nephilim heritage for approximately six generations tends to experience at least one instance of something that [Rules of Magic] and [magical rules of inheritance] would describe as "truly bizarre."[^241125-7]
- There are a number of species that decend from the nephilim. Each is the
  result of at least one hereditary "truly bizarre" mutation. Most had several things happen at once, a few had several different situations across history.
  - mermen - These were once a magically powerful people who used inheritances
    from the Dominions to transmute themselves to survive [the great Flood].
  - dwarfs[^241125-8] - The dwarfs also decend from nephilim that were punished
    for their actions at the time of [the great Flood]. At that time, they were one of the most diverse populations of nephilim (that is, they had a broad cross section of different powers).
  - goblins - people, descendant from the dwarfs, who are highly susceptible to
    greed, envy, and wrath. Their form has been distorted by the sins of their forefathers centuries ago. Once, they would have ranked in this list below the veela. However, over the centuries a gradual increase in average effective inteligence.[^241125-9] Similarly, the physical changes wrought on them have "softened" and so they are less hideous than described by authors like Tolkien who have packaged aspects of the magical world as fiction. Overall, despite their flaws, these populations retained their
    cognative ability and magic. They are particularly strong inheritors from
    the Virtues, Powers, and Archangels, with lesser inheritances from the
    Principalities and angels. Their creation of the trolls at the beginning of the [goblin wars] explains why they were punished so harshly (as to have
    originally lost nearly all free will - 90% impact).
  - hags - a people who are consumed by envy and lust. They have particularly
    strong inheritances from the Thrones, reasonable inheritances from the
    Virtues and Powers. Some have partial inheritances of random other types.
    Hags are known for using infant sacrifice in evil magical rites. These
    sins robbed their ancestors of all they can now value.
  - centaurs - a nearly primordial people (inheriting from both the the
    Seraphim and Cherubim) who, not just as individuals, but as a people,
    selfishly abused divination magic until something truly bizarre happened.
    - Their form transmuted to a half animal form to reflect the fact that
      their free will is nearly gone. They now have a herd instinct that rules
      much of their behaviour.
    - They became nearly immune to the magic of the Thrones as practised by
      other mortals. It is next to impossible to confound or imperious a
      centaur for example. This is in part because they perceive the magic of
      the attempt. This is a mitigation of their curse, which happened
      because while divination is evil, their _intentions_ were not, and their
      _understanding_ of their act flawed.
    - Centaur communities are almost universally violent, wrathful and even
      more highly xenophobic people. This is in part because their herd instinct cannot sense non-centaurs and they reject the personhood of those who do not appear to their herd sense. It is in part because they depend so much on that herd sense that they do not significantly develop individual self control. They _could_ develop it, they (typically) _do not_.
    - they remain addicted to divination, as such they perpetuate these effects
      to the next generation endlessly.
    - the ranking in this list between centaur and veela is debatable. Any
      single centaur is probably less free than any single veela, but as a
      herd, centaurs are capable of slightly more autonomy than pure veela are
      either as individuals or in groups (since veela have no herd, or in their
      case flock, effect).
    - centaurs are unique amoung the decendants of the nephilim in that the
      remain nearly unchanged, with inheritances only from two choirs, and little to no physical change since their inception.
  - veela - a people punished primarily with changes to their magic,
    reproduction, and lifespan. The placement of veela on this list is highly controversial. In raw cognative ability, a veela is roughly equivalent to a normal human. The problem is in her emotional inteligence. Many veela have essentially no control over their emotions, and this triggers the magic of her punishment.
    - See [The Veela Curse][AI] for an in depth description.
    - Veela are also complex to categorize because the nature of the veela
      "curse" makes it difficult for researchers to distinguish between the so-called "full" and "partial" veela.
    - The veela is the only example of a "race" that is purely female, it
      depends on cross breeding to survive. Due to the nature of its magic, any female child is born veela. See [The Veela Curse][AI] for more details.
  - giants - Church [records][Giants] show that the giants come from the
    creators of the house elves. Behold in them what man would be if left without his mind, the only hope they have is that their intellects are so clouded that it is nearly impossible for them to actually commit a mortal sin. Should any be willing to be missionary to the giants, the grace of baptism would be nearly unopposed, because these beings have so little ability to freely choose to do anything, and even less ability to understand something is gravely wrong.

    Author's note:
    The scholars here do not have the knowledge to be more precise, if you refer to the author's section of [Inheritance], you can see the effects of abusing magic on concupiscence. Over the centuries, this effect has been gradually reduced by goblins who have successfully lived virtuous lives against probability.

    Author's note:
    I really dislike what Mrs. Rowling did with the dwarfs in _the
    Chamber of Secrets_.[^210518-1] I am giving them my own Goblin based back story, since her version of Goblins is a mix of Tolkien's Dwarfs and Goblins.

[^241125-7]:
    Author's note:
    I'm building off of the statement from cannon that if magical users hadn't intermarried with muggles they would have all died out, and infering that most families simply hide their muggle connections, and/or that the "sacred 28" list simply omitted them in an act of historical revisionism. I'm also guessing there are some missing generations in the one family tree we have, that of the Potter family.

### Other Races

Other "races" are not really people at all, they have varying levels of
intelligence, but are all effectively the same as meeting different qualities of
AI players, as if you were encountering cyborgs.

The creation of these "races" is an abomination, and the more nearly human, or
in other words the more perfectly they simulate free will, the greater the
abomination. This will definitely have had _Screwtape_ style bizarre effects
on the perpetrators of these crimes against creation and their descendants.
This is true because of the moral confusion it causes - these "races" do not
have immortal souls the way humans, angels, nephil, or the nephil descended
races do, and yet they appear as if they should. It is true because their
creation mocks the creation of man. And lastly, it is true because their
creation, particularly that of the house elves and the trolls, has created
groups that exist at odds with true charity: in the case of the trolls a "race"
that cannot rise above rage, and in the case of the house elves a "race" that
can never be fully freed.

- Acromantula - created from spiders (obviously) by an unknown nephil or group
  of nephilim. Acromantula are capable of learning human speech, but do not
  speak anything that could be defined as a language in the wild.[^210916-3]
- Bowtruckle - created by the extreme use of magics on tree branches by an
  unknown agency (may be directly demonic).
- fairies/imps/doxies - created by the extreme use of magics on (different)
  insects, these beings appear humanoid, but still reproduce by laying eggs like
  insects. Unlike gnomes, they have some ability to form long term memories,
  but only very limited ability to learn from these experiences; their actions
  are guided by incredibly strong instinct rather than by reasoning. They are
  very like domesticated cats and dogs in this respect; a dog might remember its
  owner, but its behaviours will always be more governed by instinct than not.
  It is known that, in addition to her crimes of enslavement, fairies and
  doxies were created by the woman who became the first veela. It is unknown
  who first created imps.
- ghoul - unknown origin. Often treated as a pet.[^210916-4]
- gnomes - created by the extreme use of magics on clay figures, these beings
  have no long term memory at all. It is unknown who created these.
- house elves - created by the extreme use of magics on an unknown mammal (not a
  human), they are the most nearly human of all created beings. They are
  capable of learning, loyalty and betrayal; they have memories equivalent to
  ours. They closely mimic having true free will, just as some human scientists
  speculate the highest animals do. When bound, and elf can "feed" on the bond,
  using its master's magic to amplify its own. This stronger magic also slows
  the elf's ageing process. Any bond at all will slow an elf's ageing by a factor
  of 2 (age half a year for each year you live). If the elf feels itself to be
  _part of the family_, the bond can slow ageing by an additional factor of 2
  (each year ages you a quarter of a year). If the elf feels its contribution
  is _critical_, then, independent of the feeling of family, (but not
  independent of being bound) the elf can gain a factor of 2. If the elf feels
  that it is _fully utilised_ (kept free from idleness), it gains a factor of
  _4_. Where a human gets stressed by being overworked, an elf actually gets
  _healthier_ if it cannot complete the work necessary. However, not just any
  work will have this life extending effect, only _disinterested_ work does.
  That is, only work done for work's sake, or work done altruistically has the
  life-extending effect. These effects, including the limitation on types of
  work, was (cruelly) built into them to ensure that elves would remain loyal.

  The effects of the bond have, by and large, had the desired effect. Since the
  elf's base average lifespan is only twenty years, being unbound is a huge
  thing for elves. Elves have grown/matured enough to start working by age
  three, and reach full physical and mental maturity around age five, which is
  the earliest they can be bound. They were created by the ancestors of the
  giants, before they lost their magic, but after they had already grown large
  enough to need helpers with more nimble fingers.

  - a bound elf (1/2) who feels him/her self part of the family (divide by 2
    again), is critical to the family's welbeing (another 1/2 on top), and is
    fully utilised (1/4) would thus age at a rate of 1/32nd normal. In other
    words they would live to on average 485 years old instead of 20 years (5
    years ageing at a normal rate before being bound, added to 15\*32).
  - from this we can conclude that Dobby would be, in human terms, considered
    very nearly suicidal in his desire for freedom. He was bound (factor of
    2), and fully utilised (factor of 4 on top of that), but neither part of
    the family nor critical. He thus, prior to being freed, aged at a rate of
    1/16 normal (out of a possible 1/32th).

- Leprechaun - created by the use of extreme magics on an unknown mammal, by an
  unknown being.
  > More intelligent than the fairy and less malicious than the imp, the pixie
  > or the doxy, the leprechaun is nevertheless mischievous.[^210916-5]
- Pixie - The pixie largely resembles an imp in behaviour and intelligence, but
  the fact that it bears live young suggests a different origin. We have no
  true history of how they came to be.
- Red Cap - even less intelligent than trolls, it is suspected that like them
  they were originally created for some type of combat. That being said, no
  real knowledge of their origin is known.
- Sphinx - created by the extreme use of magic on a lion by an Egyptian nephil,
  the only true unknown is how the sphinx survived the great Flood. We are
  fairly confident, mostly by process of elimination, that its creators did not.
- trolls - created by the extreme use of magics on apes, the _most_ intelligent
  trolls might be able to perform similarly to a human with mental retardation
  capable of living in a group home. This is not a fair comparison however, the
  human is suffering from a disability; the troll is performing with unusual
  _capability._ Believed to be created by the ancestors of the goblins.
