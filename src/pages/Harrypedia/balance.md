One of the troubling things about the world that Mrs. Rowling has created is
that it is unbalanced towards being fallen.  This is perhaps no where
so obvious as in the case of the so called [non-beings].  With the
exception of [poltergeists], which are apparently based on "chaos,"
[^211020-10] all of these "non-beings" are evil creatures.  While I am
okay with [Dark Magic] being difficult to impossible to fully repair to
some extent, I have limits.  I can accept the idea of acts having
consequences that require divine intervention to fully heal.  I cannot
accept that *if* magic is not fundamentally tainted (as in the real
world it would have to be if it existed), that it *is* fundamentally
unbalanced towards evil.

* Evil creatures are indestructible, but on the side of good, the
  closest we come is the phoenix which seems to have a rather useless
  form of immortality, and *can* heal, but only if you can earn the
  loyalty of the bird in question (to get its tears).[^211020-11]
* Evil spells cannot be blocked, cannot be fully healed, may in fact be
  fully irreversible.  The only good equivalent is a mysterious magic
  that Lily invoked that no one actually understands.
* potions alone seems somewhat balanced with things like the death potion
  balanced by the elixir of life, and debates on the exact effects of the
  draught of living death.
* While mandrakes might be useful, there seems to be more plants that
  harm you than plants that conspicuously help you.
* [Occlumency][] is dependant on "shut[ting] down" and "deny[ing] essential
  parts" of oneself.[^230109-1]  As I discuss further on the page
  dedicated to it, this is not healthy.

Why do we not have shields that cannot be breached, or can only be cast to
protect someone else, but are stronger than standard shields?  Why do
we not *see* instances of the healing magic that Mrs. Rowling implies
makes mundane health problems irrelevant?  Harry should be healed of
his vision problems, someone else cured after being crushed by a giant
(since that is, in essence a mundane injury), or after a catastrophic
fall from a broom (explaining why [Madam Pomfrey][] hates Quidditch).
Since dementors play an important role, so to should some of the more
benevolent creatures.  Sure, Fawkes is critical with the basilisk, but
that creature is so evil it needs its own balance.  And yes, Buckbeak
shows up a few times, but so too do Acromantula, which, again, are
mostly evil.

In short, magic seems to have massively escalated the fallen nature of the
world.  If love is so powerful, why is [Lily][]'s self sacrifice the only
example of its power that we see?[^230109-2]  This is perhaps not amply
clear from [Snape]'s poor description of the whole thing, but fan
fiction authors have more or less worked it out to my satisfaction.
Read _[Brumous][]_ by SeriouslySam, where this whole empty your mind
thing is actually explored.  To protect those you love from the danger
of being possessed by [Riddle][], [Harry][] must *show love less*,
compartmentalise his love for others, to the point that people *cannot
tell he loves them.*  Does this even *sound* like authentic love at
this point?  When you cannot even show it properly?  The only defence
against possession, mind reading, and other mental invasions that take
your will away is to become a cold emotionally distant person who
borders on a trying to split their own personality?  I'm sorry, if that
is true, evil has won.
