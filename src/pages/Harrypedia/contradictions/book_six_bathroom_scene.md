### The Quote

> … Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci —” 
> 
> “SECTUMSEMPRA!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.

### The Facts

1. Harry had started to fall as Malfoy starts his curse.
1. Harry is *on the floor* and thus *has finished falling* **_before_**
   1. Malfoy finishes casting
   1. Harry starts his curse.
1. Malfoy's pronunciation of the curse is interrupted.  He does not miss, rather
   he never actually successfully casts.

### Analysis

I am far from the first to note the problems in this passage.[^230125-1]  The
problem is that "[sectumsempra][]" is a much longer word than [crucio][] and
that [Malfoy][]'s aristocratic drawl must be exaggerated to ludicrous
proportions for there to be any possibility of [Harry][] finishing the much
longer word first after starting later.  Take any two people with a normal
speaking ability, and get them to try to say both words.  If they start at
anywhere near the same time, the one saying "[crucio][]" will finish first.

This could have been resolved by making [Snape][]'s custom curse shorter, or by
allowing [Malfoy][] to cast but miss (because [Harry][] was moving).  It could
also have been resolved if [Malfoy][] lacked the ability to make the curse fully
effective, and thus [Harry][] was less than fully disabled by it.

However, as things stand, we have a time paradox.  [Harry][] casts his curse
while [Malfoy][] is frozen in time.
