As stated in my [Introduction][] to this reference, I have found it necessary
to split my sources up in to primary, secondary, tertiary, and even
_quaternary_ sources in an attempt to resolve as many as possible of the
contradictions in said source material. Unfortunately even with this effort,
we are still left with a cannon that is inconsistent at times, impossible in
places, and infuriatingly vague in all to many areas. These are some, but not
all, of the more glaring and more important contradictions and instances of
illogic.[^230125-1]

[^230125-1]: I realise that not all examples of illogic are contradictions, but for ease of use, I am lumping the two together.
