Charm

## Description

An ancient charm that conjures a magical guardian. The guardian, if fully
corporeal, generally takes the form of the animal with whom the caster shares
the deepest affinity. The guardian is a projection of all your most positive
feelings, and will repel a [Dementor][]. Size of the animal is not reflective of
the power of the guardian, but rather brightness. The description claims that
someone sufficiently impure casting this spell will cause maggots to gush from
the casting wand which will consume the castor.
