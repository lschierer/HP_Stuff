This passage has bothered me over and over again, beyond what I can fully
justify and well beyond what I can support with canonical references.

It basically comes down to two facts.

The first is the common saying, commonly misattributed to Joseph Goebbels, "If
you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to
believe it."  This is not the only place we hear [Snape][] claiming that
[Harry][] is "a determined rule-breaker," "arrogant", or "attention-seeking."
Indeed these claims will come up over and over again.

The second fact is that the teachers *do* treat Harry oddly.  [Dumbledore][]
claims they find him "modest," and "likeable" but [McGonagall][] will have no
trouble believing that he has lured both [Malfoy][] and [Neville][] out of
bounds after hours, *and found it funny.*[^231003-4]  That is so at odds with
his actual
personality, that, as I note when I discuss her character, one wonders who
exactly she is punishing.  [Professor Sprout][] will also have no trouble
believing that this "modest" boy was so "attention-seeking" that he put his own
name into the Goblet of Fire - hence she treats him coldly after his name comes
out.[^20210901-2]  Note, that is before the first Skeeter interview, so it is
not the lack of media attention on Cedric that is at fault.

You can even find examples where [Dumbledore][] may be showing some signs of
suspicion. Yes, each of these can be explained away as trying to gain
[Harry][]'s trust, going through the motions of being impartial, or similar.
The point is that the above passage is from *very early* in [Harry][]'s first
year, probably before Halloween, else [Dumbledore][] would know that [Snape][]
is already keeping a close eye on Quirrell.  How many times can even
[Dumbledore][] hear how arrogant [Harry][] is before it begins to, at least a
little, influence his thinking?  Especially when we know that [Dumbledore][]
was *particularly* concerned that [Harry][] grow up away from fame and the ego
it would engender?

In the series that starts with _[Harry Potter: Lost][B12HPL1]_, Bear12 portrays
a universe in which the magical world thinks that [Harry][] has died, and a
young boy who thinks of himself as "Adam Winters" comes to [Hogwarts][] as a
homeless orphan.[^20210901-3]  As the series progresses, this version of
[Dumbledore][] picks up on every single way in which "Adam" \([Harry][]\)
resembles a young [Tom Riddle][], sometimes even only remotely.  This makes
[Dumbledore][] suspicious.  In the "real" series, the "real" [Harry][] also
resembled [Tom Riddle][] in some key ways.  Add in [Snape][] effectively
(though unconsciously, since I do not think [Snape][] knows who [Tom Riddle][]
became) emphasising those similarities …

A second parallel is set up in _[Perilous Journey][]_.  In this alternate
universe, sbmcneil builds on the distance that [Dumbledore][] places between
himself and [Harry][] in the canonical [Book 5][].  Here, [Dumbledore][] fears
that [Riddle][] may actually *control* [Harry][], not just use the connection
to spy on him or implant dreams.  Can we say with certainty that the "real"
[Dumbledore][] did not in fact fear just this?  He *admits* no such fear, but
it is *inferred*.  [Dumbledore][] admits he feared that [Riddle][] would use the
connection to "try and possess you."[^221109-1]  Would not such a possession
allow [Riddle][] not just access to spy on [Dumbledore][] but to manipulate
[Harry][]'s body, and perhaps even cast other spells through him?  As you can
see, sbmcneil's point of departure is truly very small.

Given such a fear, that [Harry][] would not be in full control of himself, even
if [Dumbledore][] trusted *[Harry][]'s* ultimate goodness, he distrusts
*[Riddle]'s* to an equal extent.  If he cannot trust who is in control of the
body, and dare not let anyone know that such a possession is possible, then
**functionally** he ([Dumbledore][]) must act distrustful of [Harry][].  Others
such as [McGonagall][] and [Sprout][] might well pick up on that distrust.
