As I have noted elsewhere, one of the problematic things with writing child
protagonists is that it almost *requires* incompetent adults.  Unfortunately
this so often means dysfunctional families as well.  Mrs. Rowling seems
particularly prone to this, and the Grangers are no exception. 

We only know of a three Grangers, and two of them *have no names*!
[Hermione][]'s parent's are known to be dentists, but Doctor and Doctor Granger
are only seen briefly in the second book, where they are simply described as
"standing nervously" in [Gringotts][].[^221201-1]  Beyond that, we rarely see
them, and [Hermione][] spends increasing amounts of time in the magical world.

Thus it is not precisely a blank slate in cannon for these characters.  We can
infer very little, but there are a number of key indicators here.  

* [Hermione][], an only child, spends all of second, third, fourth, and part of
  fifth year's Christmas break at school.  Given there is no mention of normal
  break between the Spring term and Summer term in any of the books, this means
  that she spends at least 10 and possibly as much as 11 months of these years
  away from home (not counting the aborted ski trip in fifth year). 
* Despite this, she consistently arrives at the [Weasleys][] before [Harry][]
  does, sometimes, as in the summer between fourth and fifth year, by at least
  a few weeks.[^221201-2] 
* As discussed in my in depth look at her character, [Hermione][] is not
  actually a well adjusted socially mature girl.  While academically gifted,
  she is socially awkward, and has much of the same lack of tact that she
  berates [Ron][] for.

Overall, this paints a picture of a girl who had a difficult childhood.  While
we cannot with any certainty say she was abused or neglected, she is already
emotionally distant from her parents *before* she starts Hogwarts, and the time
in a boarding school will only increase this distance.   She most likely had
trouble with her peers at school, and despite her tenancy to trust authority
figures, her parents did little if anything to ameliorate the situation (or
else she would trust them when she faces problematic situations in later life). 

These are not the good parents who are eager to learn more about and experience
the magical world that many fan fiction authors portray.
