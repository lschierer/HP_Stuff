### Speculation

Madam Hooch comes across as very abrupt, and reminds me strongly of some of the
teachers I have encountered over the years who have been burnt out.  That being
said, closely and carefully reading the text does technically allow for a more
charitable interpretation, so care must be taken not to let the general
inaction of the adults in the school colour your total impression of her as a
teacher.
