#### speculation

One of the things that has bothered me since I read the seventh book is
[Harry][]'s inheritance.  When I started reading fan fiction, and from author's
notes started learning more about the interviews and comments that Mrs. Rowling
has given over the years, it has bothered me even more.  [Bellatrix][] has a
vault deep deep in the caverns under [Gringotts], and while it has lots of gold
in it, it also seems to function as a storage room for heirlooms.[^200725-1]
[Harry][] on the other hand has a low security vault in the upper levels of the
caverns, containing only gold.[^200725-2]  The contents of [Harry]'s vault are
not really important until the seventh book when we have [Bellatrix][]'s to
compare against.  Even then, it might not be important, except that we find
out, also in the seventh book, that 1) the house in Godric's Hollow is still
mostly standing (part of one side is missing the roof, but that's about it) and
2) it has become a monument of sorts.

Now we know that [Harry][]'s parents had taken the family in hiding, and I
believe we read somewhere that they had not just defied [Riddle][] the
requisite three times, but had had several close calls *after* the prophesy is
given as he hunted for them. If this is true, it is safe to say that the
Godric's Hollow house probably was not their original residence when they first
got married.  But even if some prior residence was destroyed as a total loss, two
adults do not, even with an infant, live full time in hiding in a house with
nothing around them.  In fact, we *know* they did not. They had ornaments of
some sort to pack away after [Harry][]'s birthday, as well as a vase that
[Petunia][] sent for the prior Christmas.[^210902-1]  The vase she did not like
was probably not the highest priority as they fled from residence to residence,
so what else did they have?  Books, furniture, probably some photographs, maybe
some pictures, the point is Potters would have possessed *things.*  What became
of their personal property?  Why is it that per the "extra" non-book content we
have that it seems that [Harry][] inherited [Grimmauld Place] from [Sirius][],
but nothing but gold from his parents?

[James][] came from an old family.  A family like the Potters should have had
land, even if the house on it was destroyed.  Fleeing and hiding from
[Riddle][] was not the time to dispose of it, in fact I suspect that [James][]
would have intended to rebuild.  Even if he did not, the middle of a war you
are losing is not the time to sell your land.  Even if he did sell the land,
why is there no high security vault with heirlooms?  Perhaps the Potters were
not as rich as the [Blacks][] or the [Lestranges][], but Mrs. Rowling describes
them as well off,[^221129-1] old, and influential.  There should have been
heirlooms, and I doubt they were all kept in the house - particularly if the
family was being hunted.

[Blacks]: <../../Black/>

[Lestranges]: <../../lestrange/>

Fan fiction authors seem to largely agree with me.[^211117-1]  Some solve this
by giving [Harry][] such a vault that he gets access to when he is either
emancipated or turns seventeen.  Others say that [Dumbledore][] essentially
stole everything.  Still others make [James][] a fool who liquidated everything
to fund the Order of the Phoenix, only for [Harry][] to discover [Dumbledore][]
is in fact evil.  Whichever you chose, [Harry][] should have inherited more
than he seems to have. One interesting twist is that the second vault may
require something (a ring or a key) to unlock that was itself locked in the
vault in question, because *everything* the Potters owned was placed in the
vault without forethought.[^210322-1]

[^211117-1]: There are too many of these to even begin to guess where I first
    got the idea, and too many variations on it for *anyone* to come up with
    something truly original.  Speculations on how [Gringotts][] works is
    really outside the scope of a page on the Potters.
