### Analysis

There are two possible Percy Weasleys, and unfortunately we do not have the
data to know which is the real one.

### The Collaborator.

The first is the collaborator.  This Percy is wilfully ignorant of all that is
going wrong in the Ministry until it is nearly too late.  He blindly trusts
that those in authority will, do, and have use that authority rightly.  Because
they use their authority correctly for the common good, they are justified in
their actions.  He has, after all, been raised in the shadow of [Dumbledore][]'s
utilitarianism, and so this is no surprise.

This Percy honestly believes that those new to the magical world have done
something morally reprehensible because he has been told that they have done so
by a senior Ministry official.  Such a senior person would never lie about such
serious official matters, would she?  The very idea is unthinkable.  Because of
this, he continues to work for the Ministry throughout the period of
[Riddle][]'s control over it, apparently in a position in a position of trust
(we do not hear of his demotion).

This Percy is well represented in works such as, but not limited to, sbmcneil's _[Remember][]_.

### The Infiltrator

The second is the infiltrator.  This Percy, either of his own initiative, or at
the direction of Dumbledore, *does* know that something is wrong, but believes
he can do more good estranged from his family than united with them.  He
secretly sabotages the work of the so called "muggleborn commission" or in
other ways acts as an Order of the Phoenix spy within the Ministry.  He is
estranged from his family because he does not trust them to be able to
_pretend_ to be estranged, and only by *being* estranged can he manoeuvre himself
into the position of trust necessary to be an effective spy/saboteur.  

This Percy might not have felt able to explain all of this at their reunion at
the room of requirement, and may have settled for appearing less than he is, so
as to continue to be as effective as possible.  The time for clandestine action
was over, and what is important is that he be allowed to continue to act, not
that he get the credit.  This Percy has been acting all along for the greatest
good for society at the cost of his personal reputation, what is one more
sacrifice?

### Conclusion

Both of these are almost equally possible.  The second is far more satisfying,
the former unfortunately somewhat more likely, and probably if I analyse
deeply enough, more fitting with his character as (minimally) revealed in the
books.
