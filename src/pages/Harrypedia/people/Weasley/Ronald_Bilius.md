### Analysis

When you first read the [Harry] Potter books for the first time, you
cannot help but like Ron.  In retrospect, the fact that when [Harry] tells
Ron something of the Dursleys, "This seemed to cheer Ron up"[^20200728-2] is a
bit of foreshadowing. Still, the boy was eleven; he was embarrassed by his own
(perceived) poverty, that much is normal and understandable in anyone.  If
[Ginny] grew up hearing the story of The-Boy-Who-Lived, then so too did Ron -
they are only a year apart in age.  So when [Harry] empathises with Ron
instead of rejecting him, Ron feels better.  Ron expected to be ridiculed, he
got sympathy.  Feeling better, in this light, is probably fairly normal.  It is
only sinister foreshadowing because this is a book.

So really, for the first three books, Ron is pretty much the good guy.  Yes,his comments about [Hermione] being a know-it-all were insensitive, but he did immediately felt guilty when he realized she heard them.[^240313-1]  Recall that he *is* only eleven, and all eleven year olds have quite a bit to learn about appropriate behavior.  Similarly, he probably ought to be more studious, but honestly, how many of us at that age really cared about our school work as much as we ought?  Hogwarts has appalling oversight for the students unless, like at least one of the movies, you add in mandatory study halls that are not present in the books (but are probably more representative of true British public school experience).

It is in fourth year that things start to turn.  First Ron decides that
[Harry] not only put his own name in, but then lied about it.  Lets be
honest here.  We know that [Harry] did not put his name in, but [Harry],
like Ron, *did* dream of the "eternal glory" aspect of winning the tournament.
If you consider means, motive and opportunity, Ron is correct that Harry has
both motive and opportunity.

Ron's jealousy and distrust is not appealing, and I would have trouble
forgiving it.  Still, we cannot help but applaud when [Harry] *does* forgive
Ron.  [Harry] has few friends, and when I was first reading the books I was
more relieved to see [Harry] get the support he needed, I was not worried
about the deeper implications of what this says about Ron.  Also note that what
has Ron upset in _Goblet of Fire_ is not [Harry]'s fame (despite that being
what Ron talks about most), but rather the one revealing comment "you can tell
*me* the truth."[^220901=1]  He is hurt that he has been left out, but as a
particularly immature  teen-aged boy, it is easier to be angry about
[Harry's] fame than to broach the emotion filled subjected of "I think you
betrayed me." Not that this excuses him, *our* perspective outside the narative means that we know that [Harry] *did not* betray Ron, and that Ron's distrust of
[Harry] is all that is actually standing between them. 

The anger with which Ron reacts when [Hermione] goes to the Ball with Krum
probably ought to have disturbed me more.  I do not expect a fourteen year old
boy to be particularly clued in about girls.  Ron is now the equivalent of a
freshman in high school, if he went to a US school instead of a UK school.
Freshmen are just starting to get past standing awkwardly across the room from
each other, and starting to group date.  So while Ron is perhaps a little on
the immature side of things, the Ball has pushed both Ron and [Harry]
far beyond their comfort zone.

It is not the lead up to Ball then that is concerning, it is the anger that
comes when he sees [Hermione] with Krum.  He gets into a screaming match
with her, insults her, then claims that it is *her* fault for upsetting
*him.* The older Ron gets, the more his habit of reacting to embarrassment
with anger is a concern.  Lashing out to hurt those close to you because
you cannot handle your own emotions … we will see this again in sixth year
when he dates [Lavender].

Speaking of whom, come on, really?  Dating a girl just because you are
jealous of the girl you really like having kissed someone else two years
ago?  Especially right after she just asked you out?  This is not cool.
Ron is using [Lavender], purposefully hurting [Hermione], and in denial about
both behaviours.  The only excuse for [Harry] putting up with Ron is that
[Harry] is himself abused and does not really have any models on how to
handle relationships of any kind.

But really I probably would have forgiven Ron everything up until the
seventh book.  That is when I moved to actually disliking the character.

Ron's behaviour at the beginning of the summer when he accuses [Harry]
of messing with [Ginny] more or less makes sense.  If you are going to
break up with a girl, then do so.  No matter how little [Harry] wanted to
break up with [Ginny], doing so then kissing her, if he had initiated it,
would have been playing with her emotions.  We know that the kiss is
[Ginny's] idea, but I think that never occurred to Ron. In his mind,
[Ginny] is the injured party, so why would she kiss [Harry]?  He
([Harry]) *must* have started the kiss.

But somehow Ron decides that [Harry] broke up with [Ginny] because he was
really secretly attracted to [Hermione].  Sure the locket horcrux played a
role here, and Ron is not solely to blame.  The idea however is ludicrous.
[Harry] and [Hermione] have had ample opportunity to get together if they
were going to do so.  There was no need for [Harry] to have ever been
secretive about his supposed feelings.  At this point Ron is still not
admitting that he wants a relationship with [Hermione], it is pathetically
obvious, but unspoken.  [Harry] sums it up well.

> “She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and
  I reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that. I
  thought you knew.”[^20200728-3]

It is a bit odd that two teenage boys living in a dorm have not talked
about girls at all.  It would have been better if this had not remained
unspoken for so long.  But again, [Harry] comes from a background of abuse
and neglect.  He does not know how to verbalise these things.  Add in the
fact that [Harry] has been attracted to *Ron's sister* since at least the
summer after fifth year, and perhaps it is not surprising that they have
not talked.  [Harry] knows that Ron does not want to hear about [Ginny]
that way, and [Harry] probably does not want to think about [Hermione]
that way.  In fact, [Harry] probably thinks, that Ron is respecting
*[Harry]'s* feelings the same way [Harry] is respecting Ron's.

So this rambling tangent aside, where does this leave us?  We have Ron who not
only believes that [Harry] and [Hermione] are just waiting to stab him in
the back; but that [Harry] is the kind of person who will *crush* [Ginny]
that way.  Ron, instead of confronting the issue, reacts with passive
aggressive anger, uselessly sniping at everyone while offering nothing to help
the situation they are in.  Having promised to see the quest through, having
laughed off the talk of hardships, Ron then abandons them, because he is A)hungry and B) jealous of a relationship that does not even exist.  It does not speak well of Ron that the I cannot even be sure which came first in his motivations, the hunger or the jealousy. 

Ron's reunion with Harry in _[Deathly Hallows][DH1]_ is a pivotal moment for
Ron.[^220714-1]  It is, as best I can recall, the first time that Ron actually
*apologies*.

I believe Ron's repentance is real, and sincere.  Ron is not an evil person.
He is however a very very immature one, with severe character flaws.  I think
this immaturity is actually the root of most of what goes on with Ron.  At
heart, Ron really cannot picture a world in which [Harry] does not want/value
the same things Ron does, in which [Harry] is not driven by the same things
Ron is.  Thus [Harry]'s entrance in the TriWizard Tournament is so hard for
Ron because [Harry] must want the attention just as much as Ron does.  Harry's
protests about disliking his fame are taken as face saving, meaningless
protestations, because who wouldn't like being famous?  [Harry]'s money is
such an issue because Ron focuses on his own desires for money, but really
cannot picture [Harry]'s lack of support structure that gives [Harry] that
money.  Similarly [Harry] must be interested in [Hermione] *that
way*[^20210504-1] because Ron is interested in her *that way,* and [Harry]
cannot *really* be interested in [Ginny] *that way* because Ron cannot really
picture his (Ron's) sister *that way.*

It is the same thing with the horcrux hunt.  Ron, who has never *really*
suffered hardship, blithely dismisses it when the idea is in the future.  When
it becomes their shared reality however, [Harry] perseveres - he has suffered
all his life, while Ron becomes grumpy and bitter, a child upset that things are
not easy, but unwilling to work to change them.  I think that, if anything, this
insight into Ron makes his return to the hunt a greater show of growth and
strength of character than it would be in a more mature Ron.  The Ron who
returns is one who is now ready to face true hardship, with far fewer self
delusions about his own capabilities.  His growth may have been forced on him,
but he has, at least in part, risen to the challenge.

### Ron in Fan Fiction

It would be very very easy to bash Ron in any fan fiction, and very very hard
write a fan fiction in which he actually deserves the prefect's badge he gets,
or the happy ending of the cannon epilogue.  Despite my own positive words
about him as he returns to [Harry] and [Hermione] in the forest, I think
the side comment about confounding the driving examiner shows that Ron still
has a ways to go.  Thus, I would, if they were real people, worry about his and
[Hermione]'s marriage.  Ron has shown solid signs of growth over the latter
half of the seventh book, but his anger issues are major red flags, and it is
hard to feel confident that he has really matured past the jealousies that have
up through the seventh book been a core part of his character.

For all my criticism of Ron, there are places where I feel many authors go too
far, one way or the other.  On one hand, Ron is good at chess, therefor he is a
master strategist who, with just a little extra reading (or maybe even with no
extra study at all), is a master of military strategy, small unit tactics, and
sometimes even related fields. On the other hand, because Hermione berates him
for his study habits, Ron is an ignoramus, a buffoon, and at times a poltroon.

Both of these are over simplified caricatures of Ron's true character.  Ron gets
the same seven owls that Harry gets, albeit with lower grades.[^20210618-5] That
being said, his grades could not be *that* much lower.  [Professor
McGonagall][MM1] does not accept students with "Acceptable" into her N.E.W.T.
class,[^20210618-6] and we have no reason to think that [Professor
Flitwick][FF1] has a differing policy.  This means that Ron's grades differ
from [Harry]'s by one letter in one class, not counting history, in which Ron
might well have done *better* than [Harry].

The problem is that the chess master version of Ron should do better, and the
jock version of Ron should not be able to do this much.  Military academies
*teach* strategy, analysis of enemy patterns, tactics, and so on.  None of
these are fields Ron can realistically pick up almost overnight.  If he could,
then he would be one of those incredibly annoying students, of whom I have run
into more than one, who simply do not need to study to effortlessly get top
marks.  On the other hand, if he is an idiot, no amount of copying
[Hermione]'s homework would allow him to get seven O.W.L.s with at least five
Exceeds Expectations with a practical portion for many (all?) of the ones he
did (relatively) well in.  Sure, Ron does not get top marks, but he is expected
to be able to at least pass the advanced N.E.W.T classes.

The other place that fan fiction authors do Ron an injustice is his supposed
intolerant attitude towards all things [Slytherin].  In an admittedly cursory
review of the first book to review my own impressions, I can find only one
biased remark from Ron on the topic, when he discusses his upcoming sorting
with [Harry] while still on the train.  He states that he cannot imagine
what would become of him if sorted into [Slytherin], but he is hardly happier
with the thought of [Ravenclaw].[^221213-1].  Other than that, Ron's comments
seem to largely stem from a fairly black and white view of the world and
[Malfoy]'s over the top behaviour.
