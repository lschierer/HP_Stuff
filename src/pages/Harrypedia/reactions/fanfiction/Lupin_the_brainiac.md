One of the more common fannon ideas is that [Remus Lupin] was the most inteligent of the Marauders. This is sometimes stated explicitly, other times it is done by stating that "[Hermione] is [the younger generation's] [Remus]" or that "[Hermione] is a female [Remus]." Either way, there is a strong implication that he did the thinking and planning for [James] and [Sirius].

The problem is that _[Lupin]_ states that [James] and [Sirius] were "the cleverest students in the school."[^240130-1] Supporting his admittedly biased statement, [McGonagall] describes the other two with these words: "Both very bright, of course exceptionally bright."[^240130-2] This flatly contradicts the idea that the pair of them were morons who relied on [Lupin] to do their thinking.

This thought pattern is generally used by those who have so strongly bought into Mrs. Rowling's redemption of [Snape] that they need him to have _always_ been in the right, and _actually_ morally superior to those he showed such hatred and derision towards. This is incredibly shallow thinking. I do not believe that [Snape] was anywhere near as reformed as Mrs. Rowling would have us believe by the Epilogue in [book seven]. That being said, the redemption arc she describes is _truly_ an attempt at a redemption arc. [Snape] certainly _was_ quite clearly fallen, and, per cannon, trying to make amends for his past failings. For this to mean anything, those failings must then _be quite real_.

If [Snape] _was_ \*_actually_ quite fallen in his younger years, we do not _actually_ need to minimize [James]' intelligence. I believe it was precisely his _actual_ ability that, in part, made [Snape] resent him so much. Do not be fooled by the comments [Snape] makes about [James] being a typical brainless jock.[^240130-3] This is a combination of hatred and self-delusion speaking.
