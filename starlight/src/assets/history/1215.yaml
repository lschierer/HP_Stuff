    blurb: Magna Carta
    description: |
      Magna Carta first signed.  Per the article on it, it is clear that Catholicism is either universal, or nearly so, by this point. If we are to use the barons' rebellions as the origins of the Wizengamot, then wizarding culture has been fairly heavily influenced by Christianity by this point.  How influenced?  In other words, how much of the wizards' conversion is real and how much is for show?

      Reference the "Fat Friar"'s presence as a Hogwarts' ghost. Even if they are not practising Catholics, how much of the pagan culture have they actually lost? This is not a purely academic question; its answer will determine how much of the magic that multi-generational wizarding families practice is just wands, potions, and engraved runes and how much is ritual song, dance, chants, sacrifices, meals, and other elements of paganism.  It will also determine how, for lack of a better word, Victorian wizarding society can possibly become.
