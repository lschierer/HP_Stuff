    blurb: The Ministry of Magic established.
    date: 1707
    description: |
      The Ministry of Magic established. It seems clear that the
      Wizarding world was already in hiding.  It is also notable
      that the Wizengamot predates the Ministry, as the first Minister
      was "Previously head of the Wizengamot."
