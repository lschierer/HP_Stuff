While [Ginny] has flaws, I remain partial to this pairing. Unfortunately fan
fiction rarely does it justice.

        Comments: In general the idea that [Ron] and [Hermione] are part of     
        some plot to deceive and monitor [Harry] 24/7 is ludicrous.  Children simply are not capable of maintaining that level of deception.  This story however provides a reasonable explanation for the scenario.

        Comments: In this story, [Harry] does not trust [Dumbledore] after the
        revelations at the end of 5th year.  [Remus] steps up to take an active role in [Harry]'s life, and [Ginny] doesn't date Dean.  One of the notable features of this story is that amulets are made to allow [Ginny] to siphon power from the other Weasleys.

        Comments: This story features [Harry] and [Ginny], but is *really* about the failings of [Dumbledore] and [Lupin].  What would have happened if [Sirius] had not seen the newspaper from Fudge, but rather died when Riddle raided Azkaban?

        Comments: This bond story is one of the longer ones.  I really like the
        way it does [Molly] and [Percy], and their opposition to [Harry] and
        [Ginny].  I dislike some of the other choices the author has made
        though.  There is a bit of torturing characters to provide angst, and the setup to cause the whole scenario is a bit chaotic.  The author attempted to fix this with a prequel that, I think, actually managed to confuse things more.

        Comments: This story ignores the concept of [Horcruxes], and all the
        messiness that goes with them.  It focuses in the locked room in the
        Department of Mysteries, the idea of multi-compartment, multi-room
        trunks, and magical animagus transformations.  I rarely like [Harry] as a phoenix, but this story handles it reasonably well.  What I *really* like is the trunks.

        Comments: This story pre-dates [Ginny]'s confidence around [Harry] to
        his time in [Grimmauld Place] rather than the slower and mostly off
        "screen" build-up that we see in the canonical story line.  Here
        [Ginny] convinces and helps [Harry] to prepare for his trial rather
        than rely on [Dumbledore].  This turns out to be for the best, as
        [Lucius] is rather more openly active in this version.  It is
        unfortunate that the author did not develop this concept further.

        Comments: This really focuses more on Ron and [Hermione] than it does on
        [Harry] and [Ginny], and is one of the stories that, while sticking with
        canonical couples, leans towards [Hermione] as world saviour and [Harry]
        as *her* side-kick.  Fortunately it only leans that way.  Still, I would
        prefer a stronger [Ginny].

        Comments: Featuring a manipulative but not evil [Dumbledore], and a
        redeemable [Snape], this one is a super-powered [Harry] story with a bit of a twist.  There is a bit of a bond in this one, but it is very under-stated.

        Comments: I have always wished that the author had chosen to expand this
        one out into a full universe setting, rather than a one-shot.  It written in reverse, even once you have read it all several times and understand it fully, it is delightful.  The premise is that [Harry] and [Ginny] have met before, and so when [Harry] meets [Ron] on the train, [Ron] stalks off in a huff because he resents being viewed as [Ginny]'s brother (he wants to stand out remember).  This leaves [Harry] feeling very alone, so his wish at the Sorting is for a friend, and thus Hufflepuff.... and it all flows from there.

        Comments: Despite its unfinished state, this is one of my favourite after the battle depictions.  One, I doubt Mrs. Weasley came face to face with that particular boggart made real without consequences.  Two, I do not think that Mrs. Weasley is ready for [Ginny] to be in a relationship. Yes, in book three they talk about love potions,[^220711-1] but given her over-protective and overbearing nature, I do not think she will be ready for [Ginny] to be in a *serious* romantic relationship until *she* sets said relationship up.  I suspect this remains true even if she would have otherwise approved of said relationship.  I also think that while [Ron] shows a fair amount of character growth across the latter chapters of book seven, he and [Hermione] have a lot further to go than [Harry]. This story gets all these things right.

        Comments: In many ways this is a shorter version of _[Realizations]_.
        The Weasleys think of [Ginny] as a little girl, therefore she cannot be
        in a serious relationship, therefore she isn't in one. [Harry] broke up
        with her, therefore he isn't interested in her, so why would they be
        together?  These two statements sum up all the energy that is left when
        you are lost in grief.  The downside to this shorter version is that [Ginny] does a ton of lying and then blames her family for not realizing she is lying.

        Comments: also unfortunately unfinished, this story is another great
        example of [Harry] and [Ginny]'s mutually supporting relationship.
        This one is AU in that they get together sooner, and Umbridge is able to
        expel them.  This also show cases [Dumbledore]'s distrust of [Harry]
        and [Molly] as overprotective.

        Comments: Yet another work by this author, this one has the premise that
        [Hermione] does not actually get along with [Ginny], and that
        [Percy] is not any more happy with his family's association with
        [Harry] after the war than he was during it.

        [Harry] has magicked himself *out of his body* and [Ginny] decides to

        highly amusing.

        Comments: I have always wished this were the first of a series.  In this, [James] and [Lily] are able, despite being dead, to induce a dream of what *might be* in [Harry], said dream being the six books covering years two through seven.  The alternate universe kicks in because in this story, trauma causes magical children to mature faster in odd ways.

        Comments: I think what I like about this one is that I can see where it
        comes from.  I sincerely believe that [Ron] and his brothers *would*
        have reacted poorly to the idea of [Harry] and [Ginny] dating if
        [Harry] had not utterly surprised them with his show of affecting for
        her after the quidditch match in book six.  I believe the intervention is entirely realistic, as is [Harry]'s response to it.

        Comments: I do not often like either redeemed [Snape] nor books with
        Albus Severus, and this book and its sequel contain both.  Despite that,
        I do enjoy it.  This book has one plot element that I particularly like,
        [Harry] crafts runes that amplify the power of the sacrifice he makes when he allows [Riddle] to kill him.

        Comments: I am a bit conflicted on this one.  On one hand, I like the
        stronger [Harry]/[Ginny] interaction.  The amulet induced bond is an
        interesting idea as well.  On the other hand, the premise of the story
        is to minimally extend canon to allow for the stronger relationship.
        In many ways I feel that it fails at that.  I dislike what it did with
        [Hermione], feel that [Ron]'s discovery of the relationship could
        have been done better, and *really* dislike much of the early [Luna]
        arc.

        Comments: This is a sweet story that highlights the way that Mrs. Rowling missed the boat in understanding the role love plays in motivating people.  It is a bit spoiled by the harsh note of the killing curse in the last line, but if you ignore the self-hatred implied there, it is excellent.

        Comments: I have mixed feelings about this series, and it *is* a series and not a single work published in parts and recollected into one using the series mechanism.  The works vary in size from tiny snippets to full scale novels and *everything* in between, though most are short stories.  I rather strongly dislike Mrs. Rowling's final epilogue, as I think it misunderstands the true nature of forgiveness and indeed *goodness.*  Thus I have issues with Albus Severus as a character.  The other big issue is that the long series of very short stories eventually bogs me down.  There are, however, a few real gems in the collection.

        third person limited narration, but it fits a pattern I dislike.
        These stories are not necessarily notable in themselves, and I

        that I am not the first or only person to note this problem.
