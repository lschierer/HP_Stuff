In general I prefer to sort based on the relationships involved. Where
that fails, based on what is happening with [Harry].

These stories are notable because you do not always have a happy ending.

    <dd>Comments: Usually [Harry] is shown embracing many of [Dumbledore]'s
        flaws - he is naively forgiving, keeps secrets, and struggles with
        real emotions.  We see here that this leads to problems, but this
        version of [Harry] does not give infinite second chances.</dd>
