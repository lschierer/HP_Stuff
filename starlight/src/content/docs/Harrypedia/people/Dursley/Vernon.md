- Married [Petunia Evans][PD]
- Director of Grunnings.[^220927-1] As best I can tell, this is a board of
  directors type position, except that there is probably only one of them in
  this case, indicating that it is a smaller company. The title has a few
  legal implications, as seen [here][ukglc].

### Analysis

### Speculation

#### Socioeconmic Class

There is some discrepancy in the source material here. The first introduction
of the Dursleys states that they "have everything they wanted,"[^220927-2] but
they live in a reasonably sized house in a fairly standard suburban
neighborhood. Indeed, in writing about Privet Drive, Mrs. Rowling would later
state that she envisons the Dursleys as "smugly middle class,"[^220927-3] and
admits that the house she describes is mentally modeled off "a rather small
three bedroomed house … near Bristol."[^220927-4] This is hardly the picture
of the company director who has everything he wants.
