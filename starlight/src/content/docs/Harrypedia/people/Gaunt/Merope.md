## Analysis

The reference in book six is simply that it the squire's son "ran off with" Merope, not that he necessarily married her.[^240416-1] I suspect that Merope would not have known how to arrange either a civil or religious wedding in the non-magical world and would have been disinclined to risk attempting one with an obviously love potioned muggle at the Ministry of Magic. Thus I suspect she _intended_ to get married, but that they did not actually do so. This probably made it easier for her lover to abandon her (and the unborn baby) when she ceased dosing him with love potion.
