## Analysis

I doubt that [Tom Marvolo]'s father's first name was _actually_ "Tom." Given what I know of British society, it was almost certainly Thomas, with "Tom" being a nickname. It is likely that [Merope] never knew that fact. As such I am not listing him by this name here.

[Tom Marvolo]: tom_marvolo/
[Merope]: /Harrypedia/people/gaunt/merope/
