title: Addams Family Crossovers
author: Luke Schierer

One of the recurring ideas in fan fiction is what is called
"crossovers," where you take characters, and sometimes aspects of,
one author's work (either a single work, or a series), and "cross"
it with the base work for your fan fiction, that is embed the extra
characters in the new universe to explore how the plot of one or
both works would change.

The Addams family is interesting, because the original conception
is from newspaper comic series that started in 1938, but most people
remember them from either the 1960s television show, or one of the
more recent movie reboots.[^240910-1] If you use the 1991 movie
as your starting point, [Wednesday Addams] is within a few years
of [Harry]'s age, so it is a reasonable (that is, believable) use
of artistic license to make her the same age. While any number of
these works introduce disturbing gender-bending aspects that I would
really rather have nothing to do with, some are very well done and
quite amusing. They also bring into sharp focus the fact that Mrs.
Rowling's original work lacks any solidity to its moral framework.
